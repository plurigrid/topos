1. Implement scale-invariant self and meta-self primitives self-verification
2. Launch into the loop using Justfile random walk over random actions
3. Add new dependencies to requirements.txt
4. Update src/self_verification.py to include more sophisticated verification methods
5. Modify the Justfile to include new tasks for the enhanced self-verification
6. Add methods to assess breathing capacity, maximize trust bandwidth, and implement cognitive continuity in the higher-order operads implementation
7. Add the trust bandwidth maximization feature, breathing capacity assessment, and cognitive continuity demonstration to the "act" repository

Next steps:
- Continue refining and expanding the self-verification and meta-self-verification processes
- Explore further integration of higher-order operads with other components of the project
- Investigate potential applications of the trust bandwidth maximization and cognitive continuity features
- Consider implementing additional random actions in the Justfile for a more diverse loop behavior
