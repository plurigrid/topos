# How We Work: A Maoist Approach to Code Management

## Principles of Continuous Revolution in Code

1. **Constant Criticism and Self-Criticism**: We embrace a culture of continuous improvement through rigorous self-examination and peer review.

2. **Combat Revisionism**: We vigilantly guard against the creep of outdated or incorrect code, treating it as a form of revisionism.

3. **Mass Line in Code Review**: We believe in the collective wisdom of the team. All code changes are subject to group scrutiny and discussion.

4. **Cultural Revolution in Codebase**: Periodically, we undertake comprehensive reviews of our entire codebase, challenging all assumptions and practices.

## Handling Incorrect Changes

When incorrect changes are identified:

1. **Public Self-Criticism**: The author of the incorrect code must publicly acknowledge their mistake and explain how it occurred.

2. **Rectification Campaign**: We launch a focused effort to correct the mistake and prevent similar errors in the future.

3. **Education Through Struggle**: We use the incident as a teaching opportunity, discussing it in detail during team meetings.

## Git Blame in a Maoist Context

We use git blame not to assign individual fault, but to understand the historical development of our code:

1. **Collective Responsibility**: While git blame identifies individual contributors, we view all code as a product of the collective.

2. **Historical Materialism**: We analyze the conditions and circumstances that led to each change, not just who made it.

3. **Contradiction Analysis**: We use git blame to identify contradictions in our development process and resolve them dialectically.

4. **Continuous Revolution**: Regular git blame sessions are held to review the evolution of our codebase and identify areas for revolutionary change.

Remember, comrades: The struggle against bugs and inefficiencies is eternal, but through unity and constant vigilance, we shall prevail!
