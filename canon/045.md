0:01
please thanks Marco yeah so thanks everyone for sticking around to the end of what's been a long but very interesting day of talks um yeah so I'm
0:10
going to give an overview of the things that I that I've worked on at toos for the past couple years as well as some of
0:16
my current projects um and so since the aim is to Foster collaboration between
0:23
Chapman and topos I'm not going to go really in depth on any particular topic but try to to give an overview of some
0:29
things hopefully though with an overarching uh theme so um so my talk is
0:35
about domain specific Logics for scientific modeling I'll say more about how I think about that um I want to
0:42
start with this quote uh this is a a beautiful passage from the introduction
0:47
to Nancy cartright's famous book on sort of disunity in science and she writes we
0:54
live in a dappled world a world rich in different things with different Natures behaving in different ways the that
1:00
describe this work are a patchwork not a pyramid they do not take after the simple elegant abstract structure of a
1:06
system of aums and theorems rather they are proportioned into disciplines apparently arbitrarily grown up
1:12
governing different sets of properties at different levels of abstraction and to a large degree this is sort of the
1:18
Viewpoint that I'm going to take on on science that um science is not uh a
1:24
unified thing that where everything reduces to to physics I mean it might in
1:30
some sense reduced to physics but the way it's practiced the way we understand it is not reductionist um what um and but this
1:39
talk is supposed to be about um um trying to introduce more formalization
1:45
into science and that might be seen as intention with what I was just saying and you can see it even In this passage
1:52
this uh contrast between you know abstract structure and so forth with the rather than being apportioned into
1:58
different things and so so there's this common Viewpoint that the usage of logic
2:05
um is inherently reductive um so you might think that if one takes as a
2:10
premise that the practice of theorizing and modeling in the science is pluralistic and I believe that's true um
2:17
and but then if the use of logic is inherently reductive um then it really has no legitimate role to play in the
2:23
practice of science it will uh uh inherently introduce a false kind of reductionism and so what I want to
2:30
suggest is that is that that second point is actually not true it's a I could see how someone would have that
2:36
conception but I think from a from a modern point of view particularly the point of view suggested by category
2:42
Theory and categorical logic um logic is itself um uh best seen in a pluralistic
2:49
way and that there's not a single logic but many of them um and uh so to to
2:55
restate this Vision in a more positive way I I think that there's a lot of of
3:02
of room for the legibility and accountability and inclusivity and other
3:07
aspects of science to be improved um by making it more more clear through the
3:14
use of of of techniques from logic um and that to respect the pl plurality of
3:20
science this needs to be done using suitable um domain specific Logics so
3:26
Logics that are actually intelligible to people working on particular domains that are phrased using the concepts and
3:33
language that that they find uh intuitive and natural in their subject
3:38
and that in order for this though not to be totally disjoint and ad hoc we want to have some forms of of metall logic to
3:45
organize uh at least some of these domain specific Logics and then as a hope we we could obtain perhaps passages
3:53
or maybe even weaker Notions of comparisons between logic so there's perhaps some some some sense of unity
3:59
but nevertheless um a lot of of diversity so um to repeat
4:04
a slogan that several of my colleagues from toos have have been saying recently so we are aiming to do formal
4:11
interoperable conceptual modeling um um where uh for me the conceptual is
4:18
picking up on the idea that these Logics should be grounded in the concepts of particular science but they shouldn't
4:24
just be totally disjoint from each other there should be Notions of interoperability both between and within
4:30
Logics and and that's where category Theory can help us um so that's sort of
4:35
um an overview of sort of the sort of philosophy if you will that that has
4:40
informed a lot of my work um when I was here Chapman in in January for the uh
4:46
philosophy conference I talked more about how I think some of these ideas fit into um classic problems in the
4:52
philosophy of science um that's not what I'm going to do today I'm not actually a philosopher I I'm an applied
4:57
mathematician and I'm a software engineer so today I'm going to talk about um my my actual work on this stuff
5:03
and what it looks like in more concrete terms so um right so my work at topos um
5:11
has been broadly motivated by this sort of thing and it tends to mix um um
5:17
mathematics as particularly mathematics involving category Theory and adjacent Fields like logic and type Theory um
5:25
with um software development and I'm calling these theory in practice but I put it in scare quotes because I I don't
5:30
really like that distinction all that much to me these are these are um intertwined activities that that should
5:37
be mutually informing each other um so to give an outline of of what I'm going
5:42
to talk about I'm going to first talk about some of the more established things things that we've been working on for a couple years and have made some I
5:50
think interesting progress on um I'm then going to turn to um uh a more
5:56
recent project that I've been working on over the past year or so and finally at the end I want to talk about um some
6:01
stuff that I'm just starting that I'm really excited about okay so one of the things that
6:07
we've been at for a while now is trying to realize some aspects of this
6:12
categorical domain specific Logics idea um within uh the Julia language um why
6:20
Julia because a lot of our our intended applications have been in in science and engineering and and and D as a good
6:26
language for scientific Computing um so so um uh we have built this framework
6:33
called catlab which is a programming framework for Applied category Theory um
6:38
Concepts and we have used it to build a whole number of additional packages on top of it that that Target specific sort
6:46
of languages and Logics in different uh domains of Science and these comprise
6:52
something that we call um algebraic Julia so um we've done a whole bunch of stuff over the past few years I'm just
6:58
going to highlight a few the things that I think have a few of the things that I particularly like so um whoops one thing
7:06
that we've uh spent quite a lot of time on developed very extensively and use as a basic tool in um uh a number of our
7:15
our projects is this idea of uh categorical data structures um an idea
7:21
with a long prehistory uh but it certainly also involves my my colleague David David SPAC who early in his career
7:28
worked a lot on um databases from a category theoretic point of view um so
7:34
what we have um implemented and extended those ideas in the form of of of of a
7:40
generic kind of data structure which we use for all sorts of of purposes so I want to start by showing a little bit
7:47
about how that works so the basic outline of this this thing is that you specify a schema which is like some kind
7:54
of Simple Theory um and that's done declaratively um so down here I have a
8:00
very I have a very small simple little schema it's the schema for for weighted graphs so these are directed graphs with
8:07
weights on the edges and then um and in the top right
8:13
I'm showing snippet of code of how you would you would write down that schema in cat lab and what the system can do is
8:20
take that schema and generate an optimized um data structure for it which
8:25
you can think of as like a little database but it lives in memory um and so uh here at the bottom is a tiny
8:33
instance of data on this schema see this is a a weighted graph with three edges
8:38
and for vertices if you look at it you can see that it's a simple kind of graph it's a path graph and there some weights on the edges and so the utility of this
8:46
so this is a very kind of simple example but the utility of this is this actually a quite flexible way of of describing
8:53
data structures and if you know about category Theory um you'll know that um categories of prees or co- Preps are
8:59
extremely well behaved they're some of the nicest categories out there and they're also quite amable to computation
9:05
and so we can compute lots of stuff in them we can compute limits and Co limits and and things like that and and these
9:11
category theoretic abstractions are the basis for for um highle computational
9:16
tasks like composing systems by gluing together gluing them together via co- limits or doing rule-based rewriting and
9:24
so forth so um to say this a little more precisely
9:30
um uh if you ignore this business about data attributes which adds a little complication to the formalism the the
9:36
the basic formalism for a database without attributes is extremely simple um a category sorry excuse me a schema
9:43
is just a small category usually in practice you would present it um by generators and relations and an instance
9:51
of that is a functor into set and then a morphism of instances is a natural
9:57
transformation and from the point of view of this talk um this is like the
10:03
simplest of all categorical Logics it's the logic of a bare category usually one doesn't think about that as a logic but
10:09
you can and it and it turns out that despite it being very simple from a traditional logical point of view it
10:16
it's great for for making data structures and it's very amenable to computation and so some of the things
10:21
that can be expressed in this language include all manner of of graphs and higher dimensional analoges of those
10:27
like simpal sets cubical sets um you can do a variety of of of
10:33
diagrammatic um languages that are commonly used in different parts of the Sciences so getting closer to something
10:39
that actually maybe start like what you might do in science you know um people use um Petry Nets or
10:45
reaction networks often in Biochemistry in um um System Dynamics as well as in
10:52
some parts of emology where we've worked a fair amount people use stock and flow diagrams um wiring diagrams are more of
10:59
an applied category Theory abstraction um but they can also be constructed um
11:04
using this kind of stuff um right so I got a little ahead of myself so right I
11:10
was I was giving some examples of how um these different flavors of categorical
11:16
data structures appear in some different domains this is a pretty selective list focusing on some areas that we've
11:22
actually worked in with various collaborators um um um one example that
11:29
I hadn't mentioned yet because it's of a kind of different flavor is that we've done some work in um uh physics
11:37
simulation where we use these just as as as data structures to describe um uh
11:43
geometrical spaces so that's a different usage um they're not specifying like a model like you would use a petet to
11:49
specify a re a Ser a set of chemical reactions but here they're playing the
11:55
role of just defining the geometry to do a a ulation um so with with um right and and
12:04
so so part of the utility of of having this uh kind of common abstraction that
12:10
we can instantiate in this different places is that we can reuse the same kind of patterns again and again in
12:16
different places with pretty minimal effort so like one of the things that we can do is um you know since we can
12:22
compute Co limits in these categories we can we can make precise ways of specifying a model and a modular way
12:29
where you start with small pieces that are well understood and and build them up um um using Co limits um and and
12:38
dually it's sort of less obvious what one does with with limits maybe but they can be used to do a thing called um
12:45
stratification where you you take um say uh a model of an infectious disease like
12:51
an S type model and say well actually I want to now distinguish between people in different demographic groups people
12:58
of different ages or different genders and uh you can um you can use limits to
13:05
to factor your models in this way and a and so this kind of gets back to a point
13:10
that shall I made about correct by construction right the point of this sort of thing is not that you couldn't do this without category Theory you can
13:17
you can just grind through it but the point of doing it this way is that it's correct by construction you understand the individual pieces you understand how
13:23
they're composed and therefore you can have some confidence that the large system that you build up is actually doing what you think think you did um
13:30
which you which you might not have if you just tried to do it all by hand in one giant spaghetti mess of of
13:36
model um okay so so we like um
13:41
categorical databases we've done a lot with that but that's that's certainly not everything um so so we you you you
13:48
know it's good for compartmental type models um like you find in in
13:53
Biochemistry and um epidemiology it's not really so clear how you would use that sort of stuff to do um the sort of
14:02
uh uh like classic um OD or PD or sorry pde based uh physics simulation and so
14:09
we've um uh uh we've done some work on this where we use a different kind of
14:16
diagrammatic language which I won't get into too much to to formulate um um
14:22
physics equations um using the exterior calculus and we sort of compile them
14:27
into um a um that applies the discret exterior calculus to um um to discret Talus
14:38
operators on our geometric spaces which are represented combinatorially as um simplicial sets um
14:46
and then finally we have a piece that generates a computation graph and generates Julia code Fin and finally
14:53
generates Julia code to perform a simulation so here I'm I'm showing um the results of of one of these so has a
15:01
bit of a different flavor but it's still emphasizing a similar philosophy of correct by construction right you you
15:07
you want to specify the system at a at a high level of abstraction that or or
15:13
rather at the level of abstraction that that that scientists in the domain want to think about it and rely as much as
15:18
you can on on techniques of compilation or Sy syntheis or however you want to think about that to produce um a
15:25
simulator that will do um the computation
15:31
okay so as I was saying the typical equations of of physics that you might
15:38
want to write down um everything from like Maxwell's equations to the Navia
15:44
Stokes equations all that all that good stuff um you can't express in a in a
15:51
synthetic or diagrammatic style in a category without further structure so
15:56
once you start getting into this you're you're you're push away from the sort of bare categories that we were discussing
16:02
in the context of databases to more elaborate kinds of of categorical structure so like a natural place to try
16:08
to formulate just a a perfectly General nonlinear equation might be a cartisian
16:14
monal category or if you prefer a sort of a slightly more syntactic view on that maybe in a cartisian
16:21
multicategory um the sort of um multilinear equations that you often see
16:26
in mathematical physics um uh are naturally formulated in um a
16:32
symmetric monal category or a symmetric multic category that that you you would usually want to also be um have some
16:40
additive structure as well and so the point is not to to drill down into any
16:46
of these in great detail here but to indicate that if we want to um take
16:53
seriously this idea that different kinds of of scientific equations scientific
16:59
models are naturally expressed in a different sort of logical system we need
17:05
we want to ideally have a more systematic way of thinking about about these things um so from the uh from the
17:14
point of view of of categorical logic a particular kind of category with extra
17:20
structure is a logic and so we want to we want a systematic way to think about those the name that that some people
17:27
have used for this idea is a is a Doctrine which is sort of an unpleasant word but the I didn't make it
17:33
up um it but the one what one's supposed to think is that categor doctrines are
17:38
are kind of categorification of a theory so if we think that a theory or um you
17:44
know specifies a set or maybe a some a number of sets with some additional
17:50
structure a Doctrine is like that but one dimension higher so it specifies a a category or maybe a bunch of categories
17:57
that together bear some some some extra structure and so in the in the second part of this talk I'm going to talk
18:03
about some of my my uh recent work over the past year or so to to um explore um
18:13
uh um formalism for for for doctrines and a good chunk of this is Joint work
18:19
with my collaborator Michael Lambert um so um this approach to doctrines we're
18:25
calling double theories and right so so Doctrine like like the word Doctrine like the word theory is not a single
18:32
precise concept there's lot lots of different ways to try to cach that out in something that's mathematically
18:37
precise um and so this this one is based on on double categories so that's why
18:44
they're called double theories um and it has interesting feature among other
18:49
things that um a a double Theory so in order to be a Doctrine your category of
18:56
models should actually be at least a two category um because that's kind of what it means in a in a way to be a
19:02
categorical structure you should form the objects of a two category um but uh this actually gives
19:09
more than that gives you a double category of models um and so we think
19:14
that the models of a double Theory are themselves theories within that Doctrine
19:20
and that the arrows between those models those are a kind of structure preserving fure fun those are interpretations of
19:28
one Theory and another or they could be interpretations of the theory in something that looks more like a semantics so this is this is a familiar
19:34
sort of idea from categorical logic um the the pro Aros are some kind of
19:41
structure preserving funter and I I really enjoyed this point in in and Drew's talk earlier um thinking that
19:48
like you know it's actually in categorical logic one frequently talks about you know interpretations but it's
19:54
a very strong thing to be able to interpret sort of one language within another um so it's interesting to think
19:59
whether these these Pro functors which come from the theory um uh can they Pro
20:05
functors are often thought of as a kind of categorified relation and so um one thing that'd be interesting to explore
20:11
more which I haven't which I haven't done is is is whether you can actually use this give these a nice logical
20:18
interpretation but anyways um so getting back to the main thread um um one of the
20:26
things that you can do with this notion of Doctrine is formal is systematized a
20:31
number of the the kinds of categorical structures that appear in what I like to
20:36
call like the monoidal hierarchy so these aren't traditional categorical Logics um uh these are actually tend to
20:43
be simpler than those these are like simpler than a regular category coherent category or so forth um they're they're
20:49
lower in the hierarchy but they're very useful and um so the these are some of the things that appear in there so you
20:55
have you have categories sort at the bottom which is where we started with when talking about categorical databases
21:02
there are all sorts of other um interesting things in here so a very classical and important thing which is
21:07
where um categorical logic began are cartisian categories which can be viewed
21:12
as a um which which correspond in the
21:18
syntactical side to to algebraic theories um and uh I mentioned earlier
21:24
um symmetric mon categories and symmetric multic categories and stuff like that as as a natural to formulate certain kinds of other kinds of
21:31
equations um so people have worked on on doctrines in the past so I want to spend
21:37
a little time just situating this um so the standard notion of of of doctrine
21:43
that has appeared in the literature is is as a t is something called a t monad so it's a categorification of a monad um
21:50
on Cat and this theory has been extensively developed by the Australian
21:56
school so people like Kelly and lack and their collaborators and students
22:01
um uh um and so it's very powerful but but but it's quite it's quite um
22:07
intangible in a way and in particular there's no simple way to present a tonad like you can't like write one down just
22:14
as like by generators and relations and so the way I got into this was looking
22:19
for a more tangible way to be able to write down a Doctrine and so double
22:24
theories have this this this character that you can present them by generators
22:30
and relations not unlike the way you would present an ordinary Theory and categorical logic by generators and
22:35
relations and so rather than being based on on monads they're based on functorial
22:42
semantics um just like L theories are but but categorified so this is two-dimensional functorial
22:48
semantics um so just to be to say this in another way um uh you might know from
22:57
from categorical logic that there 's correspondence between certain kinds of monads on set and certain kinds of
23:02
algebraic theories um and so those are two different ways of looking at at uh
23:09
at classical algebraic theories um so so this thing that I'm working on is
23:15
fitting into the bottom right Square this table it's explaining how to
23:28
just giving a hint of where this comes from um I'm not going to go into like
23:34
lots of detail about it but I want to give a little bit of a sense of like where where where did this these ideas
23:40
come from so um so um back in the 60s I
23:46
think uh Babu observed that um if you look at a LAX funter from the terminal
23:53
category I guess the terminal by category to the which is the same thing to the to the B category of spans so
24:00
this is the B category whose objects are sets and um morphisms are spans and two
24:06
cells are maps of spans that preserve fix the feet of the spans that that data of a LAX funter is
24:13
the same thing as small category and so as I understand the history um Babu was
24:19
the the one the first person to introduce uh by categories and LAX funter and this sort of example was
24:25
actually one of the motivating things that made him want to look at this concept in the first place and so it's interesting and it also generalizes in a
24:31
number of ways and so it's kind of appealing to to think that that maybe you know okay so this is some kind of
24:39
you know this notion of a LAX funter is giving us um categories so maybe uh is
24:45
could this be the beginnings of an approach to functorial semantics for doctrines and not not really not quite
24:54
in this form and the reason is that the if if you look at the sort of Maps between these LAX funs the ones that are
25:01
actually well behaved are these funny things called icons um and it turns out that those if the LAX funs correspond to
25:08
categories these icons correspond to Identity on objects funs which is a pretty restrictive and unusual kind of
25:15
map to look at between categories so in this form this story can't really get off get off the ground I think that's
25:22
the reason why it was basically kind of just kind of a curious observation for a long time um but what's interesting is
25:29
that if you give yourself a little another extra you give yourself an extra degree of freedom and we say okay I'm
25:36
going to look at a LAX funter um from the terminal double category um to the
25:41
double category of spans which is a lot like the the by category except now um
25:47
in a double category you have two directions of maps um and one of them of
25:52
one cells and one of the directions is spans like before but the other is now functions and so that is again just a
26:00
small category because it turns out that the functions don't play any role when the domain of your theory simple um but
26:08
something really important happens which is that now the N the sort of the right notion of natural transformation between
26:15
lack double functors because you have these functions available you can actually get that that these are
26:21
functors and so this to me is sort of the beginning of the story it's saying that well I can think of the terminal
26:27
double category or is being a kind of trivial Theory and it gives me the the
26:33
and it gives me the doctrine of categories just like the trivial theory in onedimensional categorical mod gives
26:39
you a set which is like the basic building block right and so you can think oh well now what I need to do is I
26:45
need to say well first of all I I I should generalize the domain which is
26:51
playing the role of my theory from just the terminal to some other kinds of double category um like maybe one that's
26:58
presented by finite by by generators and relations and then also I should be
27:03
generalizing um just like in you know you want to give yourself products or some other additional structures that
27:09
you can have more expressive theories and so that's basically the sort of stuff that that we that we did and um I
27:17
I just want to say one more thing about just to build a give a little bit more intuition about why this is a natural
27:23
approach to be taking so it turns out that um so I was previously explaining how LAX functors
27:30
contain within them the concept of a category what's quite cool is that a LAX
27:36
double funct actually already contains within it all four of the of the really
27:41
essential concepts of category the four most basic concept so um a LAX double
27:46
funter valued in Span sends each object to a category um that's kind of uh a
27:53
version of what I've been saying it sends every every arrow to a funter between those categories it sends the
28:00
pro arrows to Pro functors and it sends cells of the form on the left here where
28:05
you have identity proos to Natural Transformations and more generally if you have an arbitrary cell it sends it
28:11
to a a map between Pro functors which is again a kind of natural transformation um so so you know it it's
28:19
it's really has all of these Concepts s in there already and that's what makes it a natural way to deal with to deal
28:25
with doctrines and so um I think that's that's most of what I'm going to say about that um the big picture here then
28:34
with that sort of motivation is that a double theory is going to be some kind of small double category with extra
28:42
structure um a model of a double theory is a structure preserving LAX funter
28:48
from that into span by default you can look at other semantics um and then um uh it and then
28:57
it turns out I was saying before that models of a double Theory are are the objects of a double category actually if
29:03
I'm being careful I should say that it might be a virtual double category um uh
29:10
and and you can even you can upgrade it to an that to even be an equipment or virtual equipment if you if you've heard
29:17
of those heard of those things um so what we've done so far is we've
29:22
developed this this this outline basically in in detail for several kinds
29:27
of of of double theories um the ones that we call Simple which are just based on
29:33
double categories without extra structure as well as um two flavors based on double categories with products
29:40
and what's interesting about this is that generalizing products from categories to double categories is um
29:47
perhaps uh has some some twists and turns that one might not immediately expect and and there are actually at
29:53
least two fairly plausible Notions of product one of which is more flexible ible or general than the
29:59
other um okay so yes yeah
30:06
yeah yeah yes
30:22
yeah yeah yeah that's a that's a great
30:28
question I think I think very little is understood about this I mean so right so in the in the in the classic setup right
30:37
we it sort of the The syntactic View
30:42
came first right there were there were you know algebraic varieties algebraic theories La recognized that those can be
30:48
seen as categories with finite products and that story then people identified other cases like you had the typed
30:54
Lambda calculus which had previously existed and those are like us and close categories and right so so in a lot of
31:00
those cases like the the syntactic stuff was already out there um but but that's
31:06
not really the case because and I think there's some really interesting stuff to be thinking about here because um you
31:15
know the of what what are the right sort of
31:21
syntactical systems in which to understand this because here we're starting we're starting with the the categorical algebra first first which is
31:30
yeah
31:36
yeah yeah thanks that's a great question thanks um okay so I'm almost done um um
31:44
which is good I think we'll leave plenty of time for for questions and it's also been a long day so so I'm gonna in this
31:50
last section I'm going to talk about what I'm what I'm just now starting to work on um so and the the goal is to um
31:59
take some lessons from all the work that we did in cat lab and algebra Julia as well as um to start to try to actually
32:07
use this technology of double thees to to to do something and uh the the goal
32:13
is to make a um so so one thing about catlab is that is that it's really aimed
32:19
at programmers it's a programming framework um so you have to know how to program to use it um and you also need
32:25
to know a bit about the underly category more it turned out than I than I initially hoped one would have to know
32:32
um and so um you know so the aim of this new project would be to try to
32:40
actually ultimately it's my belief that these kinds of domain specific logic
32:45
should should become accessible to to working scientists and engineers and eventually other people um who and they
32:52
shouldn't have to know category theory that system should be able to um um
32:58
present the logic in such a way that that whatever Machinery is sitting behind it is is is totally uh is not is
33:06
not visible and um so you know I'm I'm starting to work on some some kind of
33:13
interactive tool which is supposed to support collaborative modeling and domain specific Logics and um I'm
33:19
starting with some of the scientific and Engineering domains that that we worked in in the past um because at least we
33:24
have some experience with those um and the system is intended to take the form
33:30
of a of a structure editor so um so uh a
33:35
a somewhat textual interface but which which has a lot of of of scaffolding and this is where I think some of the you
33:42
know ideas that Shia was telling us would would sort of plug in that right like you know AI play might play a role
33:49
here in terms of you know providing suggestions or or or guidance or tactics
33:55
but to me to me science is a is science is a human activity it's about two
34:00
things it's about first it's about human understanding of the world and the universe that we live in which is an
34:06
intrinsic good and it's about the the transformative potential to to
34:12
uh to increase our health and create more of the the the basic material Goods
34:21
that we need to live comfortable and fulfilling lives and so so so science that that's what it's about for me um
34:27
and so um modeling is a means to achieve those things and so the the tool is for
34:34
is for people um and maybe um maybe uh AI will have some role uh to play in it
34:42
but um I I I like to really think about about about languages and and how and
34:49
and trying to design good domain specific Logics that that feel feel natural to the people who work in those
34:55
areas and then from a technical point of view I'm currently thinking that I will try to parameterize these domain
35:01
specific Logics by by um double theories but I want to to get back to the
35:07
original point of the talk I I don't want to suggest that I think that every language can be parameterized in such a
35:13
way because that's just sort of repeating at a higher a higher at the next Dimension up the sort of
35:19
reductionism that I suggested should be avoided so I'm not claiming that um any
35:26
logic that you like could be could be written down this way but what I what I do know is that a number of ones that I
35:32
have worked in or wanted to have worked in can be described in this way so I think it is a good starting point for a tool that um involves uh domain specific
35:41
Logics um but also provides some ability to interoperate between them um so so to
35:50
continue to to motivate the sort of move that I'm making so at the beginning of
35:57
the talk I showed how different kinds of combinatorial structures these categorical data
36:03
structures um could be used to represent different diagrammatic languages or at least I told you that they could be used
36:09
to encode things like petrinet and stock flow diagrams and so forth and that's
36:14
connected to this in in so far as it turns out that many of these diagrammatic
36:20
languages they can be thought of as combinatorial objects mathematically but they're actually free categorical
36:26
structures so to give the the ER example of this which you which you will know if you're a category theorist right is that
36:33
um graphs in the category theorist sense are free categories um another version of this um
36:41
which has been worked out there's several different flavors of the statement that have been worked out over the years but petrinet correspond um to
36:50
um symmetric monoto categories of of different flavors um and what I want to
36:57
suggest is that these sort of things aren't coincidences um they they arise because
37:03
when you're drawing these sort of diagrams um to to represent um a model
37:09
or something right those arrows typically represent Transformations or movements of some kind and so of course
37:14
it's natural to think that those can be composed to to express you know longer
37:19
chains of interaction um or transformation or so forth so so it and of course composition is the thing that
37:26
happens in a category so so I so it's sort of natural to make this move and I think we can we we G we can gain a fair
37:33
amount by doing it so in the first instance even if we only care about the free objects like we only care about
37:39
Petr Nets um we can still get a more flexible notion of morphism um uh between them which allows
37:47
you to send say like a single transition in your petrinet to a whole composite or like string diagram of of of transitions
37:55
in another one and this sort of thing can be used to represent um um motifs which are like
38:03
commonly recurring patterns um that's a word the biologists like to use um they
38:08
can also capture um a notion of of refinement so shall we mentioned refinement is talk um and then it also
38:15
sets us up to move to more expressive kinds of logical systems the sort of um
38:20
diagrammatic equations that we were using that I alluded to earlier in our work on multiphysics simulation
38:28
um um as well as upgrades of the um the
38:34
database story to involve things like sketches or what my my colleague David calls ologs um a kind of more expressive
38:41
knowledge representation kind of thing as well as a variety of other of other interesting languages that that I that I
38:49
won't get into um so okay okay so that's the end of my talk um thanks for thanks
38:55
for your attention did you take any questions yeah [Applause]
39:03
yeah have at least 50 minutes
39:17
so thanks for your talk EV really enjoyed it um uh I may have missed
39:22
something but um I was wondering if you say a little more about schemas and their importance and and desirable
39:29
properties sure so schemas so like yeah so so here's a
39:37
simple schema so so one way to think about it the the way we we tend
39:43
to use schemas is as a way to quickly
39:48
spin up like domain specific modeling Frameworks like especially in in in
39:55
areas that compartmental type models there's you know very often people are
40:00
using a kind of of diagram to to specify the structure of the model which they
40:07
might then interpret say in ordinary differential equations or in some kind of stochastic
40:14
semantics and so this is a really useful uh common abstraction that you can use
40:20
to to say encode those kinds of diagrams um as instances of a particular schema
40:28
um and then because the system is
40:33
parametric over the schema certain operations that you might want to do on those models can be generic overall
40:39
schemas um and so this is kind of just an example of of using the uh the power
40:46
of category Theory to to achieve a higher degree of of generality than one
40:52
would typically achieve in this sort of situation like typically in software one would make a library for pet and we do
41:00
have a library for Petr Nets but it is basically just a fairly thin layer on
41:06
top of this sort of does that help it sounds uh dangerously unifying though
41:12
given your yeah right so this this really funny thing yeah I mean like
41:20
um I'm never quite sure how to how to frame it because I I I we we want to be able to see
41:28
commonalities between things and we want to be able to from just from a practical
41:33
engineering perspective right every engineer every software engineer they're always looking to try to avoid
41:39
duplicating code repeating themselves sharing functionality so right it's useful to have to have common
41:45
abstractions that we can you can reuse but but somehow it doesn't follow from that that all these things are actually
41:51
the same and it doesn't even follow that the people using the petronet need to know that they're part of some a general
41:58
thing and it also doesn't follow from that that everything that you could want to do you could be doing with say these
42:04
categorical data structures which I was arguing later in the talk you can't do either so so so there is this
42:10
interesting back and forth of like you want to try to find commonalities and common
42:17
abstractions but that doesn't imply that everything is the same thing yeah
42:39
I'm interested in um these double theories and it's
42:45
cluster of questions basically about how to understand the what I might term the relationship between like algebra and
42:51
algebraic Notions and topological Notions um so
42:57
one way of approaching this might be like is there a double theory for the category post sets or the double
43:03
category post sets and you know Auto preserving Ms and weakening relations
43:08
another way might be um let's see
43:18
what just look at some what I noted actually probably the most efficient way to ask the
43:23
question um oh what might um find limit theor like it's it's interesting want to
43:30
do some notion of categorical Doctrine and in this onedimensional setting you have to move to finite limits to get a
43:36
notional category but here you're doing internally you're you're internal to the category categories so you get
43:42
categories for free yeah um but what would happen if you those are both limits and then those are both those are
43:49
both good questions I'll start with the the second one so right so I said that uh double theories can do like so so the
43:56
sort of cartisian or finite product double theories that we've been doing can do the sort of doctrines on this
44:02
slide um they don't actually yet cover a lot of the the the Richer doctrines that
44:08
people would often think of in categorical logic and in particular they don't yet cover finite limit theories
44:15
precisely and it's it's what it's what you're maybe sort of imagining that that um that you need to have uh you need to
44:24
put more limits into your devil theories presumably in order to get to be able to express the limits that you want to have
44:30
in in its models and we have there's a lot of work to do to sort of figure out how all that all that works and um in
44:36
fact the in some sense the theory of of limits in double categories has been
44:42
around for a while but people are still finding out lots of new things about it so so so so this actually gets back to a
44:49
point that I was trying to make before it it's it's that like it's not just
44:56
like there's not not one kind of theory right there's not just one kind of double Theory there's a whole hierarchy
45:03
of those two and and it's Turtles all the way down that's how that stuff works
45:09
um so as to your first question about um relations so I think I think actually
45:16
should have accidentally glossed over this so so when I was talking about this
45:21
idea about LAX functors sending objects to categories and these other Notions
45:26
from Cate Theory this story um part of the utility of the functorial semantics
45:33
Viewpoint in this case double functorial semantic V point is that you can replace span with other double categories and in
45:40
particular you can get um um internal or
45:46
enriched categories by replacing span with suitable other things so so in
45:51
particular you can take um matrices uh over the Boolean
45:57
as your as your target as as your semantics and then it it makes
46:03
everything instead of being categories they become poets and so all this stuff or not sorry they become pre-orders what
46:09
I should say and then all this stuff becomes instead of being for categories and funs and so it becomes like you know
46:17
uh pre-orders and monotone maps and these weakening relations those are those are those are what correspond to
46:23
Pro functors so so from so so some of that stuff is contained in here although
46:29
it certainly doesn't tell you the you know the sort of connection that we was talking about with with um um you know
46:38
regular categories and ordered like you're not going to get that for free but but like you you can at least get a lot of the the basic structures you can
46:45
get sort of by turning the crank on the
46:52
yeah yeah yes yeah but there there other there are
46:59
often multiple ways to do things so like for the enrich Theory you can transfer it to your semantics that's one way to
47:07
do it is try to put it in the semantics by using matrices over some noal category V which is your base of
47:12
enrichment um uh but another thing you can do is put it into your into your
47:19
theory so so if you're one of the most common kinds of so that so that that
47:24
helps you for certain kind there's a certain common set of examples of enriched
47:29
categories which are basically you know the homets are sets but with extra structure extra algebraic structure so
47:36
maybe they're enriched in like a bil groups or or commutative monoids or whatever so for those sorts of examples
47:42
with this notion of finite product double Theory you can also put that into the theory um so so there there
47:50
are there's not always a single way to set things up and there's some flexibility about what goes in the
47:56
semantics versus what goes in the theory which is a general feature of gotor and and yeah hi hello thank you so
48:04
much was really very interesting talk how can I learn um those um
48:11
functionalities that you implemented in Julia this is a very timely question because some of my uh colleagues at
48:17
topos in particular someone named uh priia has just finished writing a a book
48:22
about the work we've been doing in algebraic Julia which I think is not quite yet publicly advertised but I
48:28
think we'll be soon so I'm really excited about that hoping that will be a good entry point um in in addition to
48:35
that um um if you go to uh this website
48:40
here algebraic julia. org I don't think it advertises the book just yet but but it does have some blog posts and papers
48:47
and other resources want to that um yeah Evan M you know just to
48:53
show that we are not a completely closed community and we have differences can you put back the the hierarchy of the
49:01
symmetric and the monoidal uhuh uhuh because you know you did mention that
49:08
that one you did mention that this is not traditional it's notor yeah and you
49:14
know there's lots missing right yeah you know there's polymorphism there is
49:20
mologic there there calculus of constructions the Lambda all this stuff
49:26
is not not there and but the question I have is about the marov category because
49:31
that is also um debatable yeah so this is a little bit of a fudge like like
49:38
okay so so so I okay so if if I want to be really careful at what I'm saying Markov
49:45
categories in the standard form that they appear in the literature like in Tobias Fritz's work are not a model of a
49:53
a double Theory you need to rejigger things slightly and the reason for this
49:58
is that markup categories do something which is really from a category Theory
50:03
perspective feels kind of odd which is that they stipulate a family of operations the diagonal or copying
50:09
operations that are not natural and and one of the things that I
50:14
was touting as a virtue of this is that um
50:20
um this Machinery makes by construction your your con makes everything be
50:27
functorial or natural or so forth by construction and usually that's what you want but in that case it it's not um and
50:34
so you actually what you need to do to make that example work is change your Viewpoint a bit and say that a Markov
50:41
category is not um something that you get by subtracting from a a cartisian
50:48
category I should actually put this arrow in the other direction right a markup category is you start with a
50:54
cartisian category that's your base of deterministic morphisms and on top of it you put your non-deterministic ones and
51:00
if you arrange things this way then you don't need to do weird stuff like putting on natural operations in your
51:06
theory so so thank you for you're you're on the ball good job so you honed in on that just to show that you know we have
51:12
friends we love each other's work but their difference is yeah yes and I and I and like I right so so I as BR as I also
51:21
noted in response to brendon's question that that like to get to these higher level and also more
51:27
traditional categorical Logics we got we have to go further
