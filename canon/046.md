\begin{abstract}
We count tilings of the rectangular grid, cylinder, and torus with arbitrary tile designs up to arbitrary symmetries of the square and rectangle, along with cyclic shifting of rows and columns, generalizing and classifying a a tiling problem first enumerated by M. C. Escher in May 1942. This provides a unifying framework for understanding a family of counting problems, expanding on the work by Ethier and Lee counting tilings of the torus by tiles of two colors.
\end{abstract}

In 1704 the Dominican priest, mathematician, and typographer Sébastien Truchet, wrote a manuscript Mémoire sur les combinaisons [29], which illustrates designs that can be made from many copies and rotations of the "Truchet tile" $\square$, one of which is reproduced in Figure 1. In 1722, Douat published a book containing futher analysis and illustrations of these tilings [9]. Truchet's and Douat's work resurfaced in Cyril Stanley Smith and Pauline Boucher's translation [27], which also introduced another tile design which is also, somewhat ambiguously, called a Truchet tile: $\mathbf{\Sigma}$.

Figure 1: Subfigure (a) is a reproduction of tiling D from Truchet's Plate 1. It is a representation of the 17 ways of tiling the $2 \times 2$ torus with Truchet tiles up to dihedral action of the square. Subfigure (b) is a reproduction of a pattern 1 from Douat. It is a representation of one of the 2196 ways of tiling the $4 \times 2$ torus by Truchet tiles up to reflection of rows and columns.

The earliest record of attempting to count these configurations was perhaps the artist M. C. Escher, who in May 1942 explicitly enumerated all of the 23 configurations of what we call the $2 \times 2$ grid on a torus by rotationally asymmetric tiles up to $90^{\circ}$ rotation, as verified by Schattschneider [25, 26]. (An illustration of this can be found in the appendix in Figure 81.)

Given some set of arbitrary tile designs, we are interested in counting ways of tiling the $n \times m$ square grid, of tiling the infinite strip in a periodic way, and of tiling the Euclidean plane in a way that is periodic both left-to-right and top-to-bottom, up to various symmetries. Both Truchet's and Douat's work were, at least in part, meant to be useful as a reference for artists, architects, and designers. In this way, the counting problems are of physical interest as they count the essentially different ways of tiling a square table, knitting a scarf with a repeating motif, or tiling the floor of a large room with a repeating design.

Ultimately, we will construct a framework for counting the number of ways of tiling the grid up to various symmetries. This provides a unifying theory for a family of problems that appear to have only been analyzed in an ad hoc manner. This will give a unifying framework for over a dozen OEIS sequences including but not limited to A047937, A054247, A086675, $\underline{\text { A179043 }}, \underline{\text { A184271, A184277, A184284, A200564, A222187, A222188, A225910, A255015, }}$ A255016, A295223, A295229, A302484, A343095, and A343096. Applying this framework has resulted in the addition of 49 new sequences to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) [24].

When we consider at the grid up to symmetries of the square or rectangle, we call this

the $n \times m$ grid, an example of which is illustrated in Figure 1. When we additionally allow cyclic shifting of columns, we call this the $n \times m$ cylinder, which is illustrated in Figure 2 . When we allow cyclic shifting of the rows in addition to the above symmetries, we call this the $n \times m$ torus, which is illustrated in Figure 3 .

The number of such tilings depends on the size of the grid, the symmetries of the grid under consideration, the symmetries of the tile designs, and the number of tile designs with a given symmetry. We formalize each of these four notions below, and use them to give a formula that counts the number of corresponding tile designs.

\section*{1 Background}

Many mathematicians, architects, artists, and others have studied and generalized Truchet tiles, starting with Douat [9], who illustrated examples of rosettes, which are tilings of the grid with dihedral symmetry, and which were studied mathematically by Hall, Almeida, and Teixeira [14]. M. C. Escher, Schattschneider [26], and [8] were perhaps the earliest to count these tilings on a torus, and Schattschneider is perhaps the earliest to ask about higher-dimensional analogs in the form of cubic tiles.

Many others have considered generalizations of these tiles, in terms of specific tile designs, other polygons, and higher dimensional analogs. Lord and Ranganathan [19] also looked at generalizations on rhombuses and on cubes. Browne considered different scales [6] and generalizations to hexagons [6]. Krawczyk generalized to other square tile designs, including tiling the faces of a cube [18]. Ahmed gave a catalog of square and hexagonal tile designs, including tile designs for octagons and the truncated square tiling [1]. Borlenghi produced perhaps the richest catalog of examples of square tile designs and also has a related US Patent [3]. Beveridge looked at generalizations of Truchet tiles to all $2 n$-gons and the faces of a cube [2]. Carlson considered putting together tiles of different scales in a compatible manner [7]. Mitchell gave further examples of triangular, square, hexagonal, and octagonal

Part (b) shows three tilings of the $2 \times 2$ grid that are equivalent under the toroidal action $\mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z}$. Part (c) shows a $2 \times 2$ torus that is equivalent to the other tori under the dihedral action $r^{3}$.

tile designs and corresponding Archimedean tilings of the Euclidean plane [21]. Walter, Ligler, and Gürsoy utilized "shape rules" to generate tile designs on the equilateral triangle, square, regular hexagon, and other convex polygons [31]. Knoll, McLellan, and Cox studied the $2 \times 2$ grid of Truchet tiles including some novel group actions related to flipping woven versions along with some constructions related to de Bruijn sequences [17].

In the 1980s the following one-line Commodore 64 computer program was a popular way to create an interesting output:

\section*{10 PRINT CHR\$(205.5+RND(1)); GOTO 10}

The program printed $\backslash$ and / to the display as an endless loop, which created maze-like figures that are closely related to those shown in Figure 72. This computer program is also the title of a book by Montfort along with nine other authors which discusses the program along with its cultural importance [22].

In addition to the connections to M. C. Escher, art, programming, and recreational mathematics, related concepts also come up in the context of statistical mechanics (especially with Smith's version of the Truchet tile) with the Completely Packed Loops model or $O(n)$ Loop Model. See, for example, Fonseca and Zinn-Justin's analysis of the $O(\tau)$-loop model on a cylider [13], Hooper's analysis of probabilities related to closed curves [15], and Nahum, Serna, Somoza, and Ortuño's loop models with crossings [23].

\section*{2 Notation and preliminaries}

In this section, we will formalize the notation of a grid and its size, the symmetries of the grid that we count up to, the symmetries of the tile designs, and the number of tile designs with a given symmetry.

\subsection*{2.1 Tilings and the grid}

In order to talk about tilings of the $n \times m$ grid, cylinder, and torus, it is important to first formalize what these are. All of these ideas start with the fundamental idea of the $n \times m$ grid, which we define as follows.

Definition 1. The $n \times m$ grid is the set $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}$, and the elements of this set are called cells.

When illustrating grids, we use the convention that the $n \times m$ grid has $n$ columns and $m$ rows, which are described using 0 -indexed Cartesian coordinates, where $(0,0)$ is the cell in the lower left corner and $(n-1, m-1)$ is the cell in the upper right corner.

\subsection*{2.2 Symmetries of the grid}

We will count grids up to various symmetries, some of which may be specified by subgroups of the dihedral group of the square, $R \leq D_{8}=\left\langle r, f \mid r^{4}=f^{2}=(r f)^{2}=\mathrm{id}\right\rangle$. Because this is a group of rotations and reflections of the grid, we call this subgroup $R$. When considering the $n \times m$ grid for $n \neq m$, we will further specify that $R \leq D_{4}$, where $D_{4}=\left\langle r^{2}, f\right|\left(r^{2}\right)^{2}=$ $\left.f^{2}=\mathrm{id}\right\rangle$ is the dihedral group of the rectangle. ${ }^{1}$

In all cases, we will use the convention that our symmetry groups act on the grid via right actions, illustrated in Figure 4. We will also use the conventions that $r$ acts on the grid by $+90^{\circ}$ rotations and $f$ acts on the grid by horizontal reflection (i.e., over the vertical line). Because the group acts on the right, $r f$ reflects the square grid over the line $y=x$ and $r^{3} f$ corresponds to matrix transposition.

Figure 4: Illustrations of the eight group actions of the dihedral group of the square $D_{8}$, which we call "identity", " $90^{\circ}$ rotation", " $180^{\circ}$ rotation", " $-90^{\circ}$ rotation", "horizontal reflection", "diagonal reflection", "vertical reflection", and "antidiagonal reflection" respectively.

Formally, we describe the action on the cell by specifying how the generators of $D_{8}$ act.
\footnotetext{
${ }^{1}$ We will later see that we use $D_{4}$ in the case of the $n \times n$ cylinder as well.
}

Definition 2. The (right) action of an element of $D_{4}$ on a cell $(x, y) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}$ is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
& (x, y) \cdot f=(n-1-x, y), \quad \text { and } \\
& (x, y) \cdot r^{2}=(n-1-x, m-1-y)
\end{aligned}
$$

In the case of an $n \times n$ grid, the action of $r \in D_{8}$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
(x, y) \cdot r=(n-1-y, x) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

These actions can be extended to all of $D_{4}$ and $D_{8}$ via the binary operation of the group, since the group action is specified for the generators.

\subsection*{2.3 Symmetries of the cylinder and torus}

Now that we know how the dihedral group acts on the $n \times n$ and $n \times m$ grids, we can also look at symmetries of the grid by cyclic shifting of rows and/or columns. When we shift just the columns, we call this a cylindrical action, which we describe with the group $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$; when we shift the rows and columns, we call this a toroidal, which we describe with the group $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}$. Both of these are named in reference to the corresponding topological identification of the square.

Definition 3. The cylindrical action of $a \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ on a cell $(x, y) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}$ corresponds to a (rightward) cyclic shift of columns:

$$
(x, y) \cdot a=(x+a, y)
$$

Definition 4. The toroidal of $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}$ on a cell $(x, y) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}$ corresponds to a (rightward) cyclic shift of columns and an (upward) cyclic shift of rows:

$$
(x, y) \cdot(a, b)=(x+a, y+b)
$$

Definition 4 is illustrated in Figure 5.

\subsection*{2.4 Compatibility of grid symmetries}

Notice that we can act on the grid with both the dihedral actions and the cylindrical/toroidal actions. In order to make the group actions of the dihedral group compatible with the cylindrical action $(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z})$ or the toroidal action $(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z})$, we define their (outer)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_22_60313e6d3f6fbdd40cceg-07.jpg?height=352&width=1044&top_left_y=213&top_left_x=562)

Figure 5: The $(3,1) \in \mathbb{Z} / 4 \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / 3 \mathbb{Z}$ acts on the $4 \times 3$ grid identified as a torus by cyclically shifting columns to the right by 3 and cyclically shifting rows by 1 .

semidirect product, $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \rtimes R$ or $(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}) \rtimes R$ respectively. As in the examples above, we define this as a right action, thinking of this as first cyclically shifting the rows and columns and then rotating or reflecting according to the element $R$.

The outer semidirect products are defined with respect to the homomorphisms $\psi: D_{4} \rightarrow$ $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z})$ and $\phi: D_{8} \rightarrow \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z})$ respectively. (We use $D_{4}$ rather than $D_{8}$ in the case of the cylinder because a $90^{\circ}$ rotation is not an isometry of the infinite strip, which is the universal cover of the cylinder.)

Definition 5. Let $\psi: D_{4} \rightarrow \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z})$ be given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
\psi_{f}(x) & =\psi_{r^{2}}(x)=-x \text { and } \\
\psi_{\mathrm{id}}(x) & =\psi_{r^{2} f}(x)=x
\end{aligned}
$$

Then the product of two elements in $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \rtimes D_{4}$ is given by

$$
\left(a_{1}, g_{1}\right)\left(a_{2}, g_{2}\right)=\left(a_{1}+\psi_{g_{1}}\left(a_{1}\right), g_{1} g_{2}\right)
$$

In the case of the torus, the definition of the semidirect product $(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}) \rtimes R$, where $R \leq D_{8}$, is essentially similar.

Definition 6. Let $\phi: D_{8} \rightarrow \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z})$ be defined on the generators $r$ and $f$ by

$$
\begin{aligned}
\phi_{f}((x, y)) & =(-x, y) \text { and } \\
\phi_{r}((x, y)) & =(y,-x)
\end{aligned}
$$

and extended to the other elements of $D_{8}$. Then the binary operation of the semidirect product of $(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}) \rtimes D_{8}$ is given by

$$
\left(\left(a_{1}, b_{1}\right), g_{1}\right)\left(\left(a_{2}, b_{2}\right), g_{2}\right)=\left(\left(a_{1}, a_{2}\right)+\phi_{g_{1}}\left(a_{1}, a_{2}\right), g_{1} g_{2}\right)
$$

Using the facts that $r$ and $f$ generate $D_{8}$ and $\phi$ is a homomorphism, together with
function composition yields:

$$
\begin{array}{lll}
\phi_{\mathrm{id}}((x, y))=(x, y), & \phi_{r}((x, y))=(y,-x) \\
\phi_{r^{2}}((x, y))=(-x,-y), & \phi_{r^{3}}((x, y))=(-y, x) \\
\phi_{f}((x, y))=(-x, y), & \phi_{r f}((x, y))=(y, x) \\
\phi_{r^{2} f}((x, y))=(x,-y), & \phi_{r^{3} f}((x, y))=(-y,-x)
\end{array}
$$

Example 7. We check our work on an individual cell. For every choice of tile and pair of symmetries, we should have

$$
\left((x, y) \cdot\left(\left(a_{1}, b_{1}\right), g_{1}\right)\right) \cdot\left(\left(a_{2}, b_{2}\right), g_{2}\right)=(x, y) \cdot\left(\left(\left(a_{1}, b_{1}\right), g_{1}\right)\left(\left(a_{2}, b_{2}\right), g_{2}\right)\right)
$$

In particular, we check in the case of the $4 \times 4$ torus with $(x, y)=(1,0),\left(\left(a_{1}, b_{1}\right), g_{1}\right)=$ $((1,1), f)$ and $\left(\left(a_{2}, b_{2}\right), g_{2}\right)=((2,0), r)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
((1,0) \cdot((1,1), f)) \cdot((2,0), r) & =((2,1) \cdot f) \cdot((2,0), r) \\
& =(1,1) \cdot((2,0), r) \\
& =(3,1) \cdot r \\
& =(2,3)
\end{aligned}
$$

Now using the semidirect product,

$$
\begin{aligned}
(1,0) \cdot(((1,1), f)((2,0), r)) & =(1,0) \cdot\left((1,1)+\phi_{f}(2,0), f r\right) \\
& =(1,0) \cdot\left((1,1)+(-2,0), r^{3} f\right) \\
& =(1,0) \cdot\left((3,1), r^{3} f\right) \\
& =(0,1) \cdot r^{3} f \\
& =(2,3) .
\end{aligned}
$$

This suggests that this semidirect product is the appropriate way to make the dihedral actions compatible with the toroidal action.

\subsection*{2.5 Symmetries of tile designs}

We are now ready to start filling in our grid with tiles. Before defining what tiles are, we introduce the following definition for convenience.

Definition 8. If $X$ is a set and $G$ has a group action on $X$, then we call $X$ a $G$-set.

Definition 9. Given $R \leq D_{8}$, a set of tile designs is simply an $R$-set. A tile design is any element of such a set.

We will always illustrate our tile designs with squares that have designs in them, but any abstract $R$-set will work in place of these illustrations. When we specify one of these tile designs together with a cell, we get a tile.

Definition 10. A tile in the $n \times m$ grid with the set of tile designs $T$ is an element of $(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}) \times T$.

Now we are ready to define a tiling of the grid, which is a specification of a tile design for each cell.

Definition 11. A tiling of the $n \times m$ grid with the set of tile designs $T$ is a map $f:(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times$ $\mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow T$. The tiles associated with the tiling are elements of the graph of the map

$$
\{((x, y), f(x, y)) \mid(x, y) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}\}
$$

We next give an example to illustrate all of these definitions.

Example 12. Suppose that $R=D_{4}=\left\langle r^{2}, f\right\rangle$, the dihedral group of the rectangle. Then

$$
T=\{, \square, \square \mathbf{D} \backslash \boldsymbol{\Delta} \backslash \boldsymbol{\Delta}
$$

is a set of tile designs, because it is an $R$-set. The $3 \times 2$ tiling

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_22_60313e6d3f6fbdd40cceg-09.jpg?height=219&width=314&top_left_y=1235&top_left_x=927)

consists of the six tiles

$$
\{((0,0), \square)((0,1), \square \square)((1,0), \square)((1,1), \boldsymbol{\square})((2,0), \square)((2,1), \square)\}
$$

Since we have now defined tiles, we are ready to talk about how the symmetries of our grid, cylinder, or torus act on tiles: dihedral actions can act on the tile design nontrivially, but cylindrical/toroidal actions always act on a tile design by the identity. We extend Definitions 2, 3, and 4 to this setting in a direct way, and illustrate this in Figure 6.

Definition 13. If $((x, y), d)$ is a tile in an $n \times m$ grid, then $g \in D_{4}$ acts on $((x, y), d)$ by

$$
\begin{aligned}
& ((x, y), d) \cdot \mathrm{id}=((x, y), d) \\
& ((x, y), d) \cdot r^{2}=\left((n-1-x, m-1-y), d \cdot r^{2}\right) \\
& ((x, y), d) \cdot f=((n-1-x, y), d \cdot f), \text { and } \\
& ((x, y), d) \cdot r^{2} f=\left((x, m-1-y), d \cdot r^{2} f\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Furthermore, if $((x, y), d)$ is a tile in an $n \times n$ grid, then $g \in D_{8}$ acts on $((x, y), d)$ by the above actions together with

$$
\begin{aligned}
& ((x, y), d) \cdot r=((n-1-y, x), d \cdot r) \\
& ((x, y), d) \cdot r^{3}=\left((y, n-1-x), d \cdot r^{3}\right) \\
& ((x, y), d) \cdot r f=((y, x), d \cdot r f), \text { and } \\
& ((x, y), d) \cdot r^{3} f=\left((n-1-y, n-1-x), d \cdot r^{3} f\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

$$

In order to understand what makes two tiles essentially different with respect to counting tilings, it is useful to define the notion of a stabilizer subgroup.

Definition 14. Let $X$ be a $G$-set. Then the stabilizer subgroup of an element $x \in X$ is the subgroup

$$
G_{x}=\{g \in G \mid x \cdot g=x\} \leq G
$$

Because our set of tile designs $T$ is an $R$-set, the relevant difference between different tile designs for the purpose of counting tilings is their stabilizer subgroups.

\subsection*{2.6 Classifying sets of tile designs}

In order to describe the essential features of a set of tile designs, we partition it into orbits with respect to $R$. By counting up the number of orbits and classifying each orbit by the (conjugacy class of the) stabilizer subgroup of one of its representatives we can understand the combinatorics of the set of tile designs completely.

Definition 15. Let $R \subseteq D_{8}$ and let $T$ be a set of tile designs (with respect to $R$ ). Then for each (conjugacy class of) a subgroup $S \leq R$, let $\mathcal{O}_{S}^{R}$ denote the number of orbits that contain a tile whose stabilizer subgroup is conjugate to $S$.

Notice that we classify up to conjugacy class because if $d$ is stable under $S$, then $d \cdot g$ is stable under $g^{-1} S g$ since $(d \cdot g) \cdot g^{-1} S g=d \cdot S g=d \cdot g$.

Example 16. Suppose we are counting tilings of the grid, cylinder, or torus up to horizontal and vertical reflection with a set of tile designs given by

$$
T=\{\square, \square, \square, \Delta, \Delta
$$

Since the symmetry group $D_{4}=\left\langle r^{2}, f \mid\left(r^{2}\right)^{2}=f^{2}=\mathrm{id}\right\rangle$ has 5 conjugacy classes of subgroups, there are five types of orbits:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\mathcal{O}_{\left\langle r^{2}, f\right\rangle}^{\left\langle r^{2}, f\right\rangle}=2 & \text { via } \quad\{\text { and }\{\boldsymbol{\square}\} \\
\mathcal{O}_{\langle f\rangle}^{\left\langle r^{2}, f\right\rangle}=1 & \text { via } \quad\{\text { and } \\
\mathcal{O}_{\left\langle r^{2}\right\rangle}^{\left\langle r^{2}, f\right\rangle}=2 & \text { via } \quad\{\text { and }\{\text { and } \\
\mathcal{O}_{\left\langle r^{2}, f\right\rangle}^{\left\langle r^{2}, f\right\rangle}=0 & \\
\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{1}}^{\left\langle r^{2}, f\right\rangle}=1 & \text { via } \quad\{
\end{array}
$$

Lemma 17. The number of tilings for a given $R$-tiling $T$ only depends on the tuple

$$
\bigoplus_{S \in \operatorname{conj}(R)} \mathcal{O}_{S}^{R}
$$

where $\operatorname{conj}(R)$ is the set of equivalence classes of subgroups of $R$ up to conjugacy.

Proof. Suppose that we have two sets of tile designs $T$ and $T^{\prime}$ with the same number of orbits for each stabilizer conjugacy class. There exists a bijection $f: T \rightarrow T^{\prime}$ such that $f(d)=d^{\prime}$ whenever $d$ and $d^{\prime}$ have the same stabilizer subgroup in $R$, that is, $R_{d}=R_{d^{\prime}}$. Then the induced map of $f$ to the tilings is also bijection of tilings.

In Appendix A.5, we explicitly enumerate all of the $R$-sets of tile designs that consist of a single orbit for each subgroup $R \leq D_{4}$ or $R \leq D_{8}$.

\subsection*{2.7 Counting strategy}

In order to count how many tilings exist up to various symmetries, we will use Burnside's lemma.

Theorem 18 (Burnside's lemma). Let $X$ be a G-set. Then the size of $X$ up to the action of $G$ is

$$
|X / G|=\frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G}\left|X^{g}\right|
$$

where $\left|X^{g}\right|$ is the number of elements of $X$ that are fixed under the action of $g \in G$.

We want to understand how many tilings are fixed under various symmetries. To do this it is necessary to categorize the symmetries of various tiles.

Definition 19. Let $T$ be a set of tile designs, where $R \leq D_{8}$. For each $g \in R$, the set of tiles that are fixed by $g$ is denoted

$$
T^{g}=\{d \in T \mid d \cdot g=d\}
$$

and the size of this set is denoted

$$
t_{g}=\left|T^{g}\right|
$$

Note that $T^{\mathrm{id}}=T$, so $t_{\mathrm{id}}$ is the total number of tile designs.

The following theorem gives us a strategy for counting the number of tilings that are fixed under a given symmetry, which is illustrated in Figure 7. For more thorough treatment in the case of Truchet tiles in particular, see Hall, Almeida, and Teixeira [14].

Theorem 20. Suppose that $s=g \in R, s=(a, g) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \rtimes R$, or $s=((a, b), g) \in$ $(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}) \rtimes R$.

Since the set of cells $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}$ form an $\langle s\rangle$-set, we partition the cells into orbits with respect to the cyclic subgroup $\langle s\rangle$, which we call $\Theta_{s}$, so that $\bigsqcup_{\vartheta \in \Theta_{s}} \vartheta=\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}$.

Then if $X^{s}$ is the set of tilings of the $n \times m$ grid that are stable under $s$,

$$
\left|X^{s}\right|=\prod_{\vartheta \in \Theta_{s}} t_{g^{|\vartheta|}}
$$

Proof. Because $\Theta_{s}$ partitions the cells into orbits with respect to the cyclic subgroup $\langle s\rangle$, the number of tilings that are fixed under $s$ is equal to the product of the number of tilings of each orbit of cells under $\langle s\rangle$.

The tiling of an orbit of cells can be specified by a single tile $d$, which then determines the rest of the orbit by $((x, y), d) \cdot s^{k}$ for $0 \leq k<|\vartheta|$. The only requirement for a valid tiling of a orbit is that

$$
((x, y), d)=((x, y), d) \cdot s^{|\vartheta|}=\left((x, y), d \cdot g^{|\vartheta|}\right)
$$

thus $d$ must be fixed by $g^{|\vartheta|}$, and so $d \in T^{g^{|\vartheta|}}$. Therefore there are $t_{g^{|\vartheta|}}$ choices for $d$ and thus for the orbit of cells containing $(x, y)$.

Thus, this reduces the problem to a matter of counting the orbits of cells under each symmetry $s$ along with counting the sizes of each of these orbits.

We proceed with Sections 3, 4, and 5, which all implement the above strategy. Each section consists broadly of fixed point counting theorems, which count tilings of the grid that are fixed under the actions of $D_{4}$ or $D_{8}$ for arbitrary sets of tile designs.

Figure 7: An illustration showing a tiling of the $4 \times 4$ torus that is fixed under $((1,2), r)$, and the six orbits of its cells with respect to the subgroup generated by this symmetry. There are three orbits of size 4 (whose tiles are stable under $r^{4}=\mathrm{id}$ ), one orbit of size 2 (whose tiles are stable under $r^{2}$ ), and two orbits of size 1 (whose tiles are stable under $r$ ).

\section*{3 Grid}

For counting tilings of the $n \times m$ rectangular grid or $n \times n$ square grid under subgroups $R \leq D_{4}$ and $R \leq D_{8}$ respectively, we count the number of tilings that are fixed under each element of $R$.

In the following two subsections, we denote the rectangular grid by RG and the square grid SG.

\subsection*{3.1 The $n \times m$ grid}

We begin by specifying the number of tilings that are fixed under each symmetry.

Definition 21. For a given set of tile designs $T$, and an element $g \in R \leq D_{4}$, the number of tilings of the $n \times m$ grid by tile designs in $T$ that are fixed by $g$ is denoted $\operatorname{fxpt}_{g}^{\mathrm{RG}}(n, m)$.

Theorem 22. For a given set of tile designs $T$ and an element $g \in R \leq D_{4}$, the number of tilings of the $n \times m$ grid by tile designs in $T$ that are fixed by $g$ is

$$
\begin{align*}
& \operatorname{fxpt}_{\mathrm{id}}^{R G}(n, m)=t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n m}  \tag{2}\\
& \operatorname{fxpt}_{r^{2}}^{R G}(n, m)= \begin{cases}t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n m / 2}, & \text { if } n m \text { is even } \\
t_{\mathrm{id}}^{(n m-1) / 2} t_{r^{2}}, & \text { if } n m \text { is odd }\end{cases}  \tag{3}\\
& \operatorname{fxpt}_{f}^{R G}(n, m)= \begin{cases}t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n m / 2}, & \text { if } n \text { is even } \\
t_{\mathrm{id}}^{(m(n-1)) / 2} t_{f}^{m}, & \text { if } n \text { is odd }\end{cases}  \tag{4}\\
& \operatorname{fxpt}_{r^{2} f}^{R G}(n, m)= \begin{cases}t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n m / 2}, & \text { if } m \text { is even } \\
t_{\mathrm{id}}^{(n(m-1)) / 2} t_{r^{2} f}^{n}, & \text { if } m \text { is odd }\end{cases} \tag{5}
\end{align*}
$$

Then the number of distinct tilings of the $n \times m$ grid up to action of $R$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{|R|} \sum_{g \in R} \mathrm{fxpt}_{g}^{R G}(n, m) \tag{6}
\end{equation*}
$$

Proof. The proof will consist of three cases.

Equation (2). This follows from the fact that $t_{\mathrm{id}}$ is the number of distinct tiles, and every tiling is fixed under id $\in D_{4}$.

Equation (3). This follows from the fact that the (right) action of $r^{2}$ on the cell $(x, y)$ is

$$
(x, y) \cdot r^{2}=(n-x-1, m-y-1)
$$

Since $r^{2}$ has order 2 , each cell is in an orbit of size 1 or 2 . The cell $(x, y)$ is fixed under the action of $r^{2}$ if and only if $n$ and $m$ are both odd and $(x, y)=\left(\frac{n-1}{2}, \frac{m-1}{2}\right)$.

Therefore when $n \mathrm{~m}$ is even, the grid is partitioned into $\mathrm{nm} / 2$ orbits of size 2 , so any fixed tiling can be specified by choosing any tile design in $T$ for each orbit. When $n m$ is odd, the grid is partitioned into one orbit of size 1 together with $(n m-1) / 2$ orbits of size 2, so any fixed tiling can be specified by choosing a tile design in $T^{r^{2}}$ for the fixed point and any tile design in $T$ for each orbit.

Equations (4) and (5). These two equations are essentially the same, so without loss of generality, we will prove the case of Equation (4). The right action of $f$ on $((x, y), d)$ is

$$
((x, y), d) \cdot f=((n-x-1, m), d \cdot f)
$$

Because $f$ is order 2 , we can conclude that $(x, y)$ is either a fixed point or a 2-cycle with respect to $f$. It follows that $(x, y)$ is a fixed point if and only if $n$ is odd and $x=(n-1) / 2$, therefore when $n$ is odd the tiling has $m$ fixed cells. The fixed cells can be specified by any tile design in $T^{f}$, and the cells in orbits of size 2 can be specified by any tile design in $T$.

Equation (6) Finally, this is a direct application of Burnside's lemma.

\subsection*{3.2 The $n \times n$ grid}

There are more symmetries and some specializations in the case of the $n \times n$ grid, which we denote SG for "square grid".

Definition 23. For a given set of tile designs $T$, and an element $g \in R \leq D_{8}$, the number of tilings of the $n \times n$ grid by tile designs in $T$ that are fixed by $g$ is denoted $\operatorname{fxpt}_{g}^{\mathrm{SG}}(n)$.

Theorem 24. For a given set of tile designs $T$ and an element $g \in R \leq D_{8}$, the number of tilings of the $n \times m$ grid by tile designs in $T$ that are fixed by $g$ is

$$
\begin{align*}
& \operatorname{fxpt}_{\mathrm{id}}^{S G}(n)=\operatorname{fxpt}_{\mathrm{id}}^{R G}(n, n)=t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n^{2}}  \tag{7}\\
& \operatorname{fxpt}_{r^{2}}^{S G}(n)=\operatorname{fxpt}_{r^{2}}^{R G}(n, n)= \begin{cases}t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n^{2} / 2}, & \text { if } n \text { is even } \\
t_{\mathrm{id}}^{\left.n^{2}-1\right) / 2} t_{r^{2}}, & \text { if } n \text { is odd }\end{cases}  \tag{8}\\
& \operatorname{fxpt}_{f}^{S G}(n)=\operatorname{fxpt}_{f}^{R G}(n, n)= \begin{cases}t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n^{2} / 2}, & \text { if } n \text { is even } \\
t_{\mathrm{id}}^{\left(n^{2}-n\right) / 2} t_{f}^{n}, & \text { if } n \text { is odd }\end{cases}  \tag{9}\\
& \operatorname{fxpt}_{r^{2} f}^{S G}(n)=\operatorname{fxpt}_{r^{2} f}^{R G}(n, n)= \begin{cases}t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n^{2} / 2}, & \text { if } n \text { is even; } \\
t_{\mathrm{id}}^{\left(n^{2}-n\right) / 2} t_{r^{2} f}^{n}, & \text { if } n \text { is odd }\end{cases}  \tag{10}\\
& \operatorname{fxpt}_{r}^{S G}(n)=\operatorname{fxpt}_{r^{3}}^{S G}(n)= \begin{cases}t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n^{2} / 4}, & \text { if } n \text { is even } \\
t_{\mathrm{id}}^{\left(n^{2}-1\right) / 4} t_{r}, & \text { if } n \text { is odd }\end{cases}  \tag{11}\\
& \operatorname{fxpt}_{r f}^{S G}(n)=t_{\mathrm{id}}^{\left(n^{2}-n\right) / 2} t_{r f}^{n} .  \tag{12}\\
& \operatorname{fxpt}_{r^{3} f}^{S G}(n)=t_{\mathrm{id}}^{\left(n^{2}-n\right) / 2} t_{r^{3} f}^{n} . \tag{13}
\end{align*}
$$

Then the number of distinct tilings of the $n \times n$ grid up to the dihedral action of the square is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{|R|} \sum_{g \in R} \operatorname{fxpt}_{g}^{S G}(n) \tag{14}
\end{equation*}
$$

Proof. This proof proceeds with four cases.

Equations (7), (8), (9), and (10). These follow directly from Theorem 22, by specifying $m=n$.

Equation (11). Firstly, notice that the tilings that are fixed under $r$ are identically those that are fixed under $r^{-1}=r^{3}$. The (right) action of $r \in D_{8}$ on a cell $(x, y)$ is

$$
(x, y) \cdot r=(n-y-1, x)
$$

therefore $(a, b)$ is a fixed point if and only if it satisfies the system of equations

$$
\begin{align*}
a & =n-b-1  \tag{15}\\
b & =a \tag{16}
\end{align*}
$$

which has an integer solution only when $n$ is odd and when $(a, b)=\left(\frac{n-1}{2}, \frac{n-1}{2}\right)$. Also, there are no cells that occur in 2-cycles. This can be seen by noticing that cells that
occur in 2-cycles are also fixed points under $r^{2}$, and by the proof of Theorem 22, we know that this occurs under the same conditions as the fixed points under $f$. Therefore all other cells occur in 4-cycles.

Therefore when $n$ is even, the grid is partitioned into $n^{2} / 4$ orbits of size 4 , each of which can be specified by any tile design in $T$; when $n$ is odd, the grid has one fixed point, which must be tiled with a tile design in $T^{r}$, and the remaining cells can be partitioned into $\left(n^{2}-1\right) / 4$ orbits of size 4 , each of which can be specified by any tile design in $T$.

Equations (12) and (13). Because $r f$ and $r^{3} f$ are conjugate, these are essentially similar, so without loss of generality, we will prove Equation (12).

The (right) action of $r f \in D_{8}$ on a cell $(x, y)$ is

$$
(x, y) \cdot r f=(y, x)
$$

Thus, $(x, y)$ is a fixed point if and only if $x=y$, otherwise it is a part of a 2-cycle. Therefore there are $n$ fixed points, which can be specified by a tile design in $T^{r f}$ and $\left(n^{2}-n\right) / 2$ 2-cycles, which can be specified with any tile design in $T$.

Equation (14). The final equation follows by a direct application of Burnside's lemma.

\section*{4 Cylinder}

Here we use the convention that the $n \times m$ cylinder is identified along its left and right sides, as illustrated in Figure 2.

Even in the case of $n \times n$ grids, we only consider tilings of cylinders up to subgroups of the dihedral group of the rectangle, because other symmetries of the square would result in swapping the pair of identified sides (the right and left side) of the grid with the pair of non-identified sides (the top and bottom).

In both the case of the cylinder and the torus, we will repeatedly use the following observation.

Lemma 25. For fixed values of $n$ and $a$, the equation

$$
\begin{equation*}
x \equiv-1-x-a \quad(\bmod n) \tag{17}
\end{equation*}
$$

has solutions that depend on the parity of $n$ and a.

When $n$ is odd, there is one solution:

$$
\begin{equation*}
x \equiv \frac{n+1}{2}(-1-a) \quad(\bmod n) \tag{18}
\end{equation*}
$$

When $n$ is even and a is odd, there are two solutions:

$$
\begin{align*}
& x \equiv \frac{-1-a}{2} \quad(\bmod n)  \tag{19}\\
& x \equiv \frac{n-1-a}{2} \quad(\bmod n) . \tag{20}
\end{align*}
$$

When $n$ and a are both even, there are no solutions.

Proof. In both cases, we write equation (17) as

$$
2 x \equiv-1-a \quad(\bmod n)
$$

Odd $n$. When $n$ is odd, 2 has a multiplicative inverse of $(n+1) / 2$, so multiplying gives the unique solution described in equation (18).

Even $n$ and odd $a$. When $n$ is even and $a$ is odd, $-1-a$ is even. Dividing by 2 gives the solution given in equation (19), and adding $n$ and dividing by 2 gives the solution in equation (20).

Even $n$ and $a$. When both $n$ and $a$ are even, $2 x$ is even and $-1-a$ is odd, so there are no solutions.

Similarly, we will repeatedly use the following lemma when counting fixed points for both the cylinder and the torus.

Lemma 26 ([20]). Given some $a \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$, if $d$ is a minimal solution to the equation

$$
d a \equiv 0 \quad(\bmod n)
$$

then $d \mid n$. Moreover, when $d$ is a divisor of $n$, there are $\varphi(d)$ choices for a that result in $d$ being a minimal solution, where $\varphi$ is Euler's totient function.

Proof. First, we can see that the least value of $d a$ will occur when $d a=\operatorname{lcm}(a, n)$, and thus

$$
d=\operatorname{lcm}(a, n) / a=n / \operatorname{gcd}(a, n)
$$

Therefore $d$ must be a divisor of $n$. The $\varphi(d)$ choices for $a$ such that $d$ is a minimal solution to $d a \equiv 0(\bmod n)$ are $a \in\{k n / d \mid 1 \leq k \leq d$ and $\operatorname{gcd}(k, d)=1\}$.

\subsection*{4.1 The $n \times m$ cylinder}

We denote the $n \times m$ cylinder by the superscript $\mathrm{C}$.

Definition 27. For a given set of tile designs $T$, and an element $g \in R \leq D_{4}$ the sum over all cyclic shifts of the number of tilings of the $n \times m$ cylinder by tile designs in $T$ that are fixed by $(a, g) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \rtimes R$ is denoted

$$
\operatorname{fxpt}_{g}^{\mathrm{C}}(n, m)=\sum_{a \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}} X^{(a, g)}
$$

where $X^{(a, g)}$ is the number of tilings fixed by $(a, g)$.

Theorem 28. The sum over all cyclic shifts of the number of tilings of the $n \times m$ cylinder by tile designs in $T$ that are fixed by $(a, \mathrm{id}) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \rtimes R$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{fxpt}_{\mathrm{id}}^{C}(n, m)=\sum_{d \mid n} \varphi(d) t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n m / d} \tag{21}
\end{equation*}
$$

Proof. For each element $(a, \mathrm{id}) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \rtimes R$, the size of the orbits is the least $d$ such that $d a \equiv 0(\bmod n)$. By Lemma 26, when $d \mid n$ there are $\varphi(d)$ choices for $a$ that result in orbits of size $d$, and each choice partitions the $n \times m$ grid into $n m / d$ orbits.

The next theorem concerns the action of $\left(a, r^{2}\right) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \rtimes R$, which is illustrated in Figure 8 .

Theorem 29. The sum over all cyclic shifts of the number of tilings of the $n \times m$ cylinder by tile designs in $T$ that are fixed by $\left(a, r^{2}\right) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \rtimes R$ is given by

$$
\operatorname{fxpt}_{r^{2}}^{C}(n, m)= \begin{cases}n t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n m / 2}, & \text { if } m \text { is even }  \tag{22a}\\ n\left(\frac{1}{2} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n m / 2}+\frac{1}{2} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{(n m-2) / 2} t_{r^{2}}^{2}\right), & \text { if } m \text { is odd and } n \text { is even } \\ n t_{\mathrm{id}}^{(n m-1) / 2} t_{r^{2}}, & \text { if } m \text { and } n \text { are odd }\end{cases}
$$

Proof. The right action of $\left(a, r^{2}\right)$ on $((x, y), d)$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
((x, y), d) \cdot\left(a, r^{2}\right)=\left((n-1-x-a, m-1-y), d \cdot r^{2}\right) \tag{23}
\end{equation*}
$$

By applying this map twice, we see that $((x, y), d)^{2}=\mathrm{id}$, so each orbit is either size 1 or size 2. Orbits are size 1 precisely when

$$
\begin{align*}
& x \equiv-1-x-a \quad(\bmod n)  \tag{24}\\
& y=m-y-1 \tag{25}
\end{align*}
$$

Equation (22a). When $m$ is even, $2 y \neq m-1$, so there are no solutions to this system of equations. Thus all orbits have size 2 totaling $n m / 2$ orbits. We can choose any tile design in $T$ to start this orbit. Then we sum this over all $n$ choices of $a \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$.

Equation (22b). When $m$ is odd, the second equation has the unique solution of $y=$ $(m-1) / 2$, which represents the middle row. The solutions for the second equation follow directly from Lemma 25, which states that when $n$ is even, the equation has two solutions when $x$ is odd and none otherwise; when $n$ is odd the second equation has a single solution.

Therefore when $m$ is odd and $n$ is even, half of the choices of $a \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ result in no orbits of size 1 , and the other half of choices of $x$ result in two orbits of size 1. In the former case, the grid decomposes into $n \mathrm{~m} / 2$ orbits of size 2 , each of which can be filled with any tile design. In the latter case, there are two orbits of size 1, which must be filled with a tile that is fixed under $r^{2}$, and the rest of the grid decomposes into $(n m-2) / 2$ orbits all of size 2 , which can be filled with any tile design.

Equation (22c). Lastly, when both $m$ and $n$ are odd, there is a single orbit of size 1 that must be filled with a tile that is fixed under $r^{2}$, the remaining $n m-1$ cells are partitioned into $(n m-1) / 2$ orbits of size 2 that can be filled with any tile design.

Figure 8: The action of $\left(a, r^{2}\right) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \rtimes R$ on a tiling is equivalent to a $180^{\circ}$ rotation of both the leftmost $n-a \times m$ sub-grid and the rightmost $a \times m$ sub-grid.

The next theorem concerns the action of $(a, f) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \rtimes R$, which is illustrated in Figure 9 .

Theorem 30. The sum over all cyclic shifts of the number of tilings of the $n \times m$ cylinder by tile designs in $T$ that are fixed by $(a, f) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \rtimes R$ is given by

$$
\operatorname{fxpt}_{f}^{C}(n, m)= \begin{cases}n\left(\frac{1}{2} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n m / 2}+\frac{1}{2} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{(n m-2 m) / 2} t_{f}^{2 m}\right), & \text { if } n \text { is even }  \tag{26a}\\ n t_{\mathrm{id}}^{(n m-m) / 2} t_{f}^{m}, & \text { if } n \text { is odd }\end{cases}
$$

Proof. Since $(a, f)^{2}=$ id, every tile is either a fixed point or appears in a 2-cycle under $(a, f)$. The right action of $(a, f)$ on $((x, y), d)$ is

$$
((x, y), d) \cdot(a, f)=((-x-a-1, y), d \cdot f)
$$

so the tiles that appear as fixed points are those that satisfy

$$
x=-1-x-a \quad(\bmod n)
$$

Equation (26a). When $n$ and $a$ are both even, there are no fixed points. When $n$ is even and $a$ is odd, there are two fixed points in each row:

$$
\begin{align*}
& x \equiv(n-a-1) / 2 \quad(\bmod n) \quad \text { and }  \tag{27}\\
& x \equiv(2 n-a-1) / 2 \quad(\bmod n) \tag{28}
\end{align*}
$$

Equation (26b). When $n$ is odd, there is one fixed cell in each row, which occurs when $x \equiv(-a-1)(n+1) / 2(\bmod n)$.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_22_60313e6d3f6fbdd40cceg-20.jpg?height=422&width=1236&top_left_y=1193&top_left_x=472)

Figure 9: The action of $(a, f) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \rtimes R$ on a tiling is equivalent to a horizontal flip of both the leftmost $n-a \times m$ sub-grid and the rightmost $a \times m$ sub-grid.

Theorem 31. The sum over all cyclic shifts of the number of tilings of the $n \times m$ cylinder by tile designs in $T$ that are fixed by $\left(a, r^{2} f\right) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \rtimes R$ is given by

$$
\operatorname{fxpt}_{r^{2} f}^{C}(n, m)= \begin{cases}\sum_{d \mid n} \varphi(d) t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n m / \operatorname{lcm}(d, 2)}, & \text { if } m \text { is even }  \tag{29a}\\ \sum_{d \mid n} \varphi(d) t_{\mathrm{id}}^{(n m-n) / \operatorname{lcm}(d, 2)} t_{\left(r^{2} f\right)^{d}}^{n / d}, & \text { if } m \text { is odd }\end{cases}
$$

Proof. We can see that $\left(a, r^{2} f\right)$ acts on the coordinates of $(x, y)$ separately, that is,

$$
(x, y) \cdot\left(a, r^{2} f\right)^{k}= \begin{cases}(x+k a, m-1-y), & \text { if } k \text { is odd } \\ (x+k a, y), & \text { if } k \text { is even. }\end{cases}
$$

Notice that the orbits of the $y$-coordinates have size 2, so it is enough to determine the size of the orbits of the $x$-coordinates. By Lemma 26, for each divisor $d \mid n$, there are $\varphi(d)$ choices for $a$ such that the size of the orbits of the $x$-coordinate is $d$.

Equation (29a). When $m$ is even, we see that $y \neq m-y-1$ has no solutions, the orbit of every $y$-coordinate has size 2 . For each $x$-orbit size $d \mid n$, each cell must be in an orbit of size $\operatorname{lcm}(d, 2)$, and there must $\mathrm{nm} / \operatorname{lcm}(d, 2)$ of them. Each can be specified by any tile design, since all tile designs are stable under $\left(r^{2} f\right)^{\operatorname{lcm}(d, 2)}=\mathrm{id}$.

Equation (29b). When $m$ is odd, we see that $y=m-y-1$ has a solution precisely when $y=(m-1) / 2$. For each $x$-orbit size $d \mid n$, if $y=(m-1) / 2$, then the orbit has size $d$, otherwise it has size $\operatorname{lcm}(d, 2)$, as in the case above. Therefore there are $n$ cells that are in orbits of size $d$ resulting in $n / d$ orbits that can be specified by any tile design that is stable under $\left(r^{2} f\right)^{\operatorname{lcm}(d, 2)}$. The remaining $n^{2}-n$ cells are partitioned into $\left(n^{2}-n\right) / \operatorname{lcm}(d, 2)$ orbits of size $\operatorname{lcm}(d, 2)$ that can be specified by any tile design.

Theorem 32. For a given set of tile designs $T$, a symmetry group $R \leq D_{4}$, and an element $g \in R$, the number of distinct tilings of the $n \times m$ cylinder is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{n|R|} \sum_{g \in R} \operatorname{fxpt}_{g}^{C}(n, m) \tag{30}
\end{equation*}
$$

Proof. We will use the convention that when we index over $g$, implicitly $g \in R$; when we index over $a$, implicitly $a \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$; and when we index over $(a, g)$, implicitly $(a, g) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \rtimes R$.

Since $\operatorname{fxpt}_{g}^{\mathrm{C}}(n, m)=\sum_{a} X^{(a, g)}$, we can see that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{n|R|} \sum_{g} \mathrm{fxpt}_{g}^{\mathrm{C}}(n, m) & =\frac{1}{n|R|} \sum_{g} \sum_{a} X^{(a, g)} \\
& =\frac{1}{|\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \rtimes R|} \sum_{(a, g)} X^{(a, g)}
\end{aligned}
$$

which counts the number of distinct tilings by a direct application of Burnside's lemma.

\section*{5 Torus}

This section builds on the work of Ethier [11] and Ethier and Lee [12]. By specializing to the set of tile designs $T=\{$,$\} , we recover their work. Irvine [16] generalized this$ in the specific context of a set of tile designs of size $n$ in the specific case that no rotation or reflection is allowed (only cyclic shifting of rows and columns), which we recover in Theorem 34 .

We distinguish between the rectangular torus, which we denoted by RT, and the square torus, which we denote by ST.

\subsection*{5.1 The $n \times m$ torus}

Definition 33. For a given set of tile designs $T$, and an element $g \in R \leq D_{4}$ the sum over all cyclic shifts of the number of tilings of the $n \times m$ cylinder by tile designs in $T$ that are fixed by $((a, b), g) \in(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}) \rtimes R$ is denoted

$$
\operatorname{fxpt}_{g}^{\mathrm{RT}}(n, m)=\sum_{(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}} X^{((a, b), g)}
$$

where $X^{((a, b), g)}$ is the number of tilings fixed by $((a, b), g)$.

Theorem 34. The sum over all cyclic shifts of the number of tilings of the $n \times m$ torus by tile designs in $T$ that are fixed by $(a, \mathrm{id}) \in(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}) \rtimes R$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{fxpt}_{\mathrm{id}}^{R T}(n, m)=\sum_{c \mid m} \sum_{d \mid n} \varphi(c) \varphi(d) t_{\mathrm{id}}^{m n / \operatorname{lcm}(c, d)} \tag{31}
\end{equation*}
$$

Proof. The size of an orbit of a tile under $((a, b), g)^{k}$ is the set of solutions to

$$
\begin{aligned}
k a & \equiv 0 \quad(\bmod n) \\
k b & \equiv 0 \quad(\bmod m)
\end{aligned}
$$

For each individual equation, the minimal choice for $k$ must be a divisor of $n$. For a given divisor $d \mid n$, there are $\varphi(d)$ choices for $a \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ so that $d a \equiv 0(\bmod n)$. Namely if $i$ is coprime to $d$, then $a=i(n / d)$ will be a minimal solution. An analogous argument holds for the second equation.

Therefore if $d \mid n$ and $c \mid m$, there are $\varphi(d) \varphi(c)$ pairs $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}$ where $a$ has order $d$ and $b$ has order $c$, and thus $(a, b)$ has order $\operatorname{lcm}(d, c)$. Therefore, each orbit of cells has size $\operatorname{lcm}(d, c)$, and so the number of orbits of cells is $n \mathrm{~m} / \operatorname{lcm}(d, c)$.

Thus, the sum of the number of orbits over each pair $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}$ gives equation (31), as desired.

The next theorem concerns the action of $\left((a, b), r^{2}\right) \in(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}) \rtimes R$, which is illustrated in Figure 10.

Theorem 35. The sum over all cyclic shifts of the number of tilings of the $n \times m$ torus by tile designs in $T$ that are fixed by $\left(a, r^{2}\right) \in(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}) \rtimes R$ is given by

$$
\operatorname{fxpt}_{r^{2}}^{R T}(n, m)= \begin{cases}n m\left(\frac{3}{4} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n m / 2}+\frac{1}{4} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n m / 2-2} t_{r^{2}}^{4}\right), & \text { if } n \text { and } m \text { are even }  \tag{32a}\\ n m t_{\mathrm{id}}^{(n m-1) / 2} t_{r^{2}}, & \text { if } n \text { and } m \text { are odd } \\ n m\left(\frac{1}{2} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n m / 2}+\frac{1}{2} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n m / 2-1} t_{r^{2}}^{2}\right), & \text { otherwise }\end{cases}
$$

Proof of Theorem 35. The orbits of cells under the group generated by $\left((a, b), r^{2}\right)$ have size either 1 or 2 , because of how we defined the semidirect product, $\left((a, b), r^{2}\right)$ has order 2 :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left((a, b), r^{2}\right)^{2}=\left((a, b), r^{2}\right)\left((a, b), r^{2}\right)=\left((a, b)+(-a,-b), r^{2} r^{2}\right)=((0,0), \mathrm{id}) \tag{33}
\end{equation*}
$$

Therefore, it is enough to count how many cells are stable under $\left((a, b), r^{2}\right)$, which depends on the parity of $n, m, a$, and $b$.

The element $\left((a, b), r^{2}\right)$ fixes a cell $(x, y)$ when

$$
(x, y) \cdot\left((a, b), r^{2}\right)=(n-1-(x+a), n-1-(y+b))
$$

This corresponds to the system of equations

$$
\begin{align*}
x \equiv-1-x-a & (\bmod n)  \tag{34}\\
y \equiv-1-y-b & (\bmod m) \tag{35}
\end{align*}
$$

whose solutions are given by Lemma 25 .

Therefore we proceed by each case

Equation (32a). When $n$ and $m$ are even, there are fixed cells only when both $a$ and $b$ are odd, by Lemma 25; in this case, there are exactly 4 fixed cells, because each equation in the system of equations has two solutions. When this occurs, it partitions the cells into 4 orbits of size 1 , which can be filled with tile designs that are fixed under $r^{2}$, and $(n m-4) / 2$ orbits of size 2 , which can be filled with any tile design.

When either $a$ or $b$ is even, there are no fixed cells, which partitions the cells into $n m / 2$ orbits of size 2 , each of which can be filled with any choice of tile design.

Since the 4 fixed cells occur for exactly one quarter of the pairs $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}$, this results in the desired equation.

Equation (32b). When $n$ and $m$ are both odd, Lemma 25 states that equations (34) and (35) have one solution.

When this occurs, it partitions the cells into 1 orbit of size 1 , which can be filled only with a tile design that is fixed by $r^{2}$, and $(n m-1) / 2$ orbits of size 2 , which can be specified with any tile design.

Equation (32c). Without loss of generality, we can assume that $n$ is even and $m$ is odd, because the proof is essentially similar in the opposite case. Lemma 25 states that equation (34) has no solutions when $a$ is even and 2 solutions when $a$ is odd; it also states that (35) has one solution.

Thus for half of the pairs $(a, b)$, there are no fixed cells, and so there are $n m / 2$ orbits, each of which can be specified by any tile design.

For the other half of the pairs, there are 2 fixed cells, which can be specified by any tile design that is fixed under $r^{2}$ and $(n m-2) / 2$ orbits of size 2 that can be specified by any tile design.

Figure 10: The action of $\left((a, b), r^{2}\right) \in(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}) \rtimes R$ on a tiling is equivalent to a $180^{\circ}$ rotations of the lower left $(n-a) \times(m-b)$ sub-grid, the lower right $a \times(m-b)$ sub-grid, the upper left $(n-a) \times b$ sub-grid, and the upper right $a \times b$ sub-grid.

Theorem 36. The sum over all cyclic shifts of the number of tilings of the $n \times m$ torus by tile designs in $T$ that are fixed by $(a, f) \in(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}) \rtimes R$ is given by

$$
\operatorname{fxpt}_{f}^{R T}(n, m)= \begin{cases}n \sum_{c \mid m} \varphi(c)\left(\frac{1}{2} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n m / \operatorname{lcm}(2, c)}+\frac{1}{2} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{(n-2) m / \operatorname{lcm}(2, c)} t_{f c}^{2 m / c}\right), & \text { if } n \text { is even }  \tag{36a}\\ n \sum_{c \mid m} \varphi(c) t_{\mathrm{id}}^{(n-1) m / \operatorname{lcm}(2, c)} t_{f c}^{m / c}, & \text { if } n \text { is odd }\end{cases}
$$
and

$$
\operatorname{fxpt}_{r^{2} f}^{R T}(n, m)= \begin{cases}m \sum_{d \mid n} \varphi(d)\left(\frac{1}{2} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n m / \operatorname{lcm}(d, 2)}+\frac{1}{2} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n(m-2) / \operatorname{lcm}(d, 2)} t_{\left(r^{2} f\right)^{d}}^{2 n / d}\right), & \text { if } m \text { is even } \\ m \sum_{d \mid n} \varphi(d) t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n(m-1) / \operatorname{lcm}(d, 2)} t_{\left(r^{2} f\right)^{d}}^{n / d}, & \text { if } m \text { is odd }\end{cases}
$$

Proof. Since $f$ and $r^{2} f$ are conjugate as elements of $D_{8}$, these fixed point formulas have essentially the same proof, so we will prove equations (36a) and (36b) specifically.

Since $(x, y) \cdot((a, b), f)=(n-1-(x+a), y+b)$, we can view $((a, b), f)$ as acting on each coordinate separately. Since $((a, b), f)^{2}=((0,2 b)$, id), we can see that the orbits of the first coordinate have either size 1 or 2 . Moreover, by Lemma 25, there are no fixed cells when $n$ is even and $a$ is even, there are 2 fixed cells when $n$ is even and $a$ is odd, and there is 1 fixed cell when $n$ is odd.

Since $((a, b), f)$ acts on the second coordinate by shifting by $b$, we see that Lemma 26 applies. Thus for each divisor $c \mid m$, there are $\varphi(c)$ choices of $b$ that produce orbits of the second coordinate with size $c$.

Equation (36a). When $n$ is even, then half of the values of $a \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ are even, and each orbit has size $\operatorname{lcm}(2, c)$ and these can be specified by any tile design.

The other half of values of $a$ are odd, which results in 2 fixed points for the first coordinate, each of which results in an orbit of size $c$ that can be specified by any tile design that is fixed by $f^{c}$. The remaining $(n-2) m$ cells then are partitioned into orbits of size $\operatorname{lcm}(2, c)$, which can be specified by any tile design.

Equation (36b). When $n$ is odd, then there is one fixed point for the first coordinate, resulting in $m$ cells where the first coordinate is fixed under the action of $((a, b), f)$. For each divisor $c \mid m$, there is a partition of these $m$ cells into orbits of size $c$. The resulting $m / c$ orbits can be specified by any tile design that fixes $f^{c}$. The remaining $n(m-1)$ cells are partitioned into orbits of size $\operatorname{lcm}(2, c)$, resulting in $n(m-1) / \operatorname{lcm}(2, c)$ orbits which can be specified by any tile design.

Theorem 37. Then the number of distinct tilings of the $n \times m$ torus up to $R \subseteq D_{4}$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{n m|R|} \sum_{g \in R} \mathrm{fxpt}_{g}^{R T}(n, m) \tag{37}
\end{equation*}
$$

Proof. We will use the convention that when we index over $g$, implicitly $g \in R$; when we index over $(a, b)$, implicitly $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}$; and when we index over $((a, b), g)$, implicitly $((a, b), g) \in(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}) \rtimes R$.

Since $\operatorname{fxpt}_{g}^{\mathrm{RT}}(n, m)=\sum_{(a, b)} X^{((a, b), g)}$, we can see that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{n m|R|} \sum_{g} \operatorname{fxpt}_{g}^{\mathrm{RT}}(n, m) & =\frac{1}{n m|R|} \sum_{g} \sum_{(a, b)} X^{((a, b), g)} \\
& =\frac{1}{|(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}) \rtimes R|} \sum_{((a, b), g)} X^{((a, b), g)}
\end{aligned}
$$

which counts the number of distinct tilings by a direct application of Burnside's lemma.

\subsection*{5.2 The $n \times n$ torus}

Theorem 38. The sum over all cyclic shifts of the number of tilings of the $n \times n$ square torus (denoted ST) by tile designs in $T$ that are fixed by $((a, b), g) \in(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}) \rtimes R$ is given by $\operatorname{fxpt}_{g}^{S T}(n)$ where

$$
\begin{align*}
& \operatorname{fxpt}_{\mathrm{id}}^{S T}(n)=\sum_{d_{1} \mid n} \sum_{d_{2} \mid n} \varphi\left(d_{1}\right) \varphi\left(d_{2}\right) t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n^{2} / \operatorname{lcm}\left(d_{1}, d_{2}\right)}  \tag{38}\\
& \operatorname{fxpt}_{r^{2}}^{S T}(n)= \begin{cases}n^{2} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{\left(n^{2}-1\right) / 2} t_{r^{2}}, & \text { if } n \text { is odd } \\
n^{2}\left(\frac{3}{4} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n^{2} / 2}+\frac{1}{4} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n^{2} / 2-2} t_{r^{2}}^{4}\right), & \text { if } n \text { is even }\end{cases}  \tag{39}\\
& \operatorname{fxpt}_{f}^{S T}(n)= \begin{cases}n \sum_{d \mid n} \varphi(d)\left(\frac{1}{2} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n^{2} / \operatorname{lcm}(2, d)}+\frac{1}{2} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{\left(n^{2}-2 n\right) / \operatorname{lcm}(2, d)} t_{f^{d}}^{2 n / d}\right), & \text { if } n \text { is even } \\
n \sum_{d \mid n} \varphi(d) t_{\mathrm{id}}^{\left(n^{2}-n\right) / \operatorname{lcm}(2, d)} t_{f^{d}}^{n / d}, & \text { if } n \text { is odd }\end{cases}  \tag{40}\\
& \operatorname{fxpt}_{r^{2} f}^{S T}(n)= \begin{cases}n \sum_{d \mid n} \varphi(d)\left(\frac{1}{2} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n^{2} / \operatorname{lcm}(2, d)}+\frac{1}{2} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{\left(n^{2}-2 n\right) / \operatorname{lcm}(2, d)} t_{\left(r^{2} f\right)^{d}}^{2 n / d}\right), & \text { if } n \text { is even } \\
n \sum_{d \mid n} \varphi(d) t_{\mathrm{id}}^{\left(n^{2}-n\right) / \operatorname{lcm}(2, d)} t_{\left(r^{2} f\right)^{d}}^{n / d} & \text { if } n \text { is odd }\end{cases} \tag{41}
\end{align*}
$$

Proof. These equations follow directly from Theorems 34,35 and 36 by specifying $m=n$.

Theorem 39. The sum over all cyclic shifts of the number of tilings of the $n \times n$ torus by
tile designs in $T$ that are fixed by $(a, r) \in(\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}) \rtimes R$ is given by

$$
\operatorname{fxpt}_{r}^{S T}(n)=\operatorname{fxpt}_{r^{3}}^{S T}(n)= \begin{cases}n^{2} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{\left(\mathrm{n}^{2}-1\right) / 4} t_{r}, & \text { if } n \text { is odd }  \tag{42a}\\ n^{2}\left(\frac{1}{2} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n^{2} / 4}+\frac{1}{2} t_{\mathrm{id}}^{\left(\mathrm{n}^{2}-4\right) / 4} t_{r}^{2} t_{r^{2}}\right), & \text { if } n \text { is even }\end{cases}
$$

Proof. First, note that the first equality comes from the fact that tilings that are stable under $g$ are stable under $g^{-1}$.

Next, note that $((a, b), r)$ is an element of order 4 , which follows from observing that $((a, b), r)=\left(\left(a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}\right), r^{2}\right)$ together with equation (33). Therefore cells appear in orbits of size 1,2 , or 4 under $((a, b), r)$, and we will count how many cells appear in each.

We begin by counting cells $(x, y)$ that are fixed by $((a, b), r)$, that is they satisfy the system of equations

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
x \equiv-y-b-1 & (\bmod n) \\
y \equiv x+a & (\bmod n) \tag{44}
\end{array}
$$

where we can substitute $y$ with $x+a$ in the first equation to get

$$
\begin{equation*}
x \equiv-x-a-b-1 \quad(\bmod n) \tag{45}
\end{equation*}
$$

Next we count cells $(x, y)$ that are fixed by $((a, b), r)^{2}$, but are not solutions to the above system of equations. These cells satisfy the system of equations

$$
\begin{align*}
& x \equiv-1-x-a-b \quad(\bmod n)  \tag{46}\\
& y \equiv-1-y-b+a \quad(\bmod n) \tag{47}
\end{align*}
$$

Equation (42a). When $n$ is odd, we can solve equation (45) using Lemma 25. We can see that this has one solution when $n$ is odd, so in this case there is one fixed cell, which can be specified by any tile design that is stable under $r$.

We can add equations (46) and (47) and use Lemma 25 to see that this system has a single solution when $n$ is odd. However, this is identically the solution that specifies the fixed point, so this does not describe an orbit of size 2 .

Thus there are $n^{2}-1$ cells that are partitioned into $\left(n^{2}-1\right) / 4$ orbits of size 4 , which can be specified by any tile design.

Equation (42b) When $n$ is even, we can see again by Lemma 25 , that there are two fixed cells when $a+b$ is odd and none when $a+b$ is even.

When we check the number of orbits of size 2, Lemma 25 shows that we have 4 solutions when $a+b$ is odd and none when $a+b$ is even, 2 of which were the fixed cells, resulting in a single orbit of size 2 .

Therefore, we can specify a fixed tiling by specifying tile designs that are fixed under $r$ for each of the two fixed cells, specifying a tile design that is fixed under $r^{2}$ for the orbit of size 2 , and specifying any tile designs for each of the $\left(n^{2}-4\right) / 4$ orbits of length 4.

\section*{Theorem 40.}

$$
\operatorname{fxpt}_{r f}^{S T}(n)=n \sum_{d \mid n} \begin{cases}\varphi(d) t_{\mathrm{id}}^{\left(n^{2}-n\right) /(2 d)} t_{r f}^{n / d}, & \text { if } d \text { is odd }  \tag{48a}\\ \varphi(d) t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n^{2} /(2 d)}, & \text { if } d \text { is even }\end{cases}
$$

and

$$
\operatorname{fxpt}_{r^{3} f}^{S T}(n)=n \sum_{d \mid n} \begin{cases}\varphi(d) t_{\mathrm{id}}^{\left(n^{2}-n\right) /(2 d)} t_{r^{3} f}^{n / d}, & \text { if } d \text { is odd }  \tag{49}\\ \varphi(d) t_{\mathrm{id}}^{n^{2} /(2 d)}, & \text { if } d \text { is even }\end{cases}
$$

Proof. These situations are essentially the same because $r f$ and $r^{3} f$ are conjugate in $D_{8}$, so we prove the case for $\operatorname{fxpt}_{r f}^{\mathrm{ST}}(n)$.

We can see that

$$
\begin{aligned}
& (x, y) \cdot((a, b), r f)^{2 k}=(x+k(a+b), y+k(a+b)) \\
& (x, y) \cdot((a, b), r f)^{2 k+1}=(y+k(a+b)+b, x+k(a+b)+a)
\end{aligned}
$$

and we can ask: what is the least $k$ such that either

$$
\begin{align*}
& x \equiv x+k(a+b) \quad(\bmod n)  \tag{50}\\
& y \equiv y+k(a+b) \quad(\bmod n) \tag{51}
\end{align*}
$$

or

$$
\begin{align*}
& x \equiv y+k(a+b)+b \quad(\bmod n)  \tag{52}\\
& y \equiv x+k(a+b)+a \quad(\bmod n) \tag{53}
\end{align*}
$$

In the first case, we want to know when $k(a+b) \equiv 0(\bmod n)$, which occurs first when $k=n / \operatorname{gcd}(a+b, n)$. We call this $d$ and note that $d \mid n$. In the second case, we can add equations (52) and (53) to get

$$
\begin{equation*}
(2 k+1)(a+b)=0 \quad(\bmod n) \tag{54}
\end{equation*}
$$

which occurs when $2 k+1=n / \operatorname{gcd}(a+b, n)$. Again, this is a divisor of $n$, so we say $2 k+1=d$ and note that this solution occurs only when $d$ is odd.

Equation (48a) Thus, when $d$ is odd, we have the system of equations

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x \equiv y+\frac{d-1}{2}(a+b)+b \quad(\bmod n) \\
& y \equiv x+\frac{d-1}{2}(a+b)+a \quad(\bmod n)
\end{aligned}
$$

which has $n$ solutions: for each choice of $x$, there is a unique choice of $y$ that satisfies both equations. Each of these solutions correspond to a cell in one of the $n / d$ orbits of length $d$, each of which can be specified by any tile design that is stabilized by $(r f)^{d}=r f$, since $d$ is odd.

The other $n^{2}-n$ cells occur in one of the $\left(n^{2}-n\right) /(2 d)$ orbits of length $2 d$ that are solutions to the first system of equations. Each of these orbits can be specified by any tile design at all.

The $\varphi(d)$ comes from the fact that for any choice of $a$ there are precisely $\varphi(d)$ choices for $b$ such that $n / \operatorname{gcd}(a+b, n)=d$.

Equation (48b) When $d$ is even, there are no choices of $(x, y)$ that simultaneously satisfy equations (52) and (53), so all $n^{2}$ of the tiles $(x, y)$ occur in orbits of size $2 d$. Each of these $n^{2} /(2 d)$ orbits can be specified by any tile design.

Theorem 41. The number of distinct tilings of the $n \times n$ torus up to $R \leq D_{8}$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{n^{2}|R|} \sum_{g \in R} \operatorname{fxpt}_{g}^{S T}(n) \tag{55}
\end{equation*}
$$

Proof. The proof of this theorem is essentially identical to the proof of Theorem 37, which follows by definition together with Burnside's lemma.

Thus for any arbitrary $R \subseteq D_{8}$ and set of tile designs, we have a formula to count the number of tilings of the $n \times n$ torus up to $R$. A formula for each choice of $R$ together with each $R$-set generated by a single tile design can be found in Appendix A.5; the corresponding illustrations can be found in Appendix B.5.

\section*{6 Next steps}

In this section, we propose several different settings for studying similar kinds of problems. Many of these may be subtle research problems, many may be good undergraduate research problems, and many may be good homework problems for a combinatorics class. Many of them would make for interesting additions to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.

\subsection*{6.1 Rectangular tori under $90^{\circ}$ rotation}

We have used the $n \times m$ torus as a model for a repeating tiling of the plane. However, in the case that $n \neq m$, we have only analyzed the case where we count tilings up to $D_{4}$, the dihedral group of the rectangle. However, for a given tile set, it is possible that a tiling of a $n \times m$ and a tiling of a $m \times n$ torus describe the same tiling of the plane; an example of this is given in Figure 11.

Conjecture 42. If a plane tiling described by an $n \times m$ torus is fixed under $((a, b), r)$, $\left((a, b), r^{3}\right),((a, b), r f)$, or $\left((a, b), r^{3} f\right)$, then it is equivalent to the tiling of a $\operatorname{gcd}(n, m) \times$ $\operatorname{gcd}(n, m)$ torus.

Similarly, it might be interesting to count irreducible plane tilings: tilings of the plane corresponding to a tiling of the $n \times m$ torus that do not correspond to a smaller torus.

Figure 11: A periodic tiling of the plane arising from a $6 \times 4$ torus tiling that is fixed under $90^{\circ}$ rotation. Notice that this tiling of the plane can also come from a $2 \times 2$ torus.

\subsection*{6.2 Other regions of the square grid.}

We also are interested in counting the number of ways of tiling shapes like Aztec diamonds or centered square numbers, as shown in Figure 12.

Figure 12: Order 1, 2, 3, and 4 centered square figures in the square tiling of the plane.

\subsection*{6.3 The Möbius strip and Klein bottle}

Since we have looked at the orientable identifications of the grid, we are also interested in the non-orientable identifications. The Möbius strip has a universal cover that is $[0,1] \times \mathbb{R}$, and the Klein bottle has a universal cover of $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$, so we can visualize them analogously to how we visualized the cylinder and torus respectively. An illustration of a tiling of the Möbius strip in Figure 13. An illustration of a tiling of the Klein bottle in Figure 14.

We are also interested in counting tilings of the real projective plane, but because the universal cover is not the Euclidean plane, it cannot be illustrated in the same manner as the Klein bottle and the torus.

\subsection*{6.4 Tilings of the triangular and hexagonal grids}

While this paper explored tilings of the square grid and related settings, it is equally natural to ask about tilings of the triangular grid and hexagonal grid. In particular, it would be interesting to explore the number of tilings of (1) triangular regions of the triangular grid, (2) hexagonal regions of the triangular grid, (3) triangular regions of the hexagonal grid, or (4) hexagonal regions of the hexagonal grid, all of which are illustrated in Figure 15.

Hexagonal tile designs have appeared in several tile-based edge-matching games such as Palago, Tantrix, Psyche-Paths, and Kaliko, which Van Ness has coined as "serpentiles" [30]. Triangular, hexagonal, and other polygonal tiles have been described by authors such as Ahmed [1], Mitchell [21], Beveridge [2], Walter [31], Bosch [4], Browne [5], and Lord and Ranganathan [19].

In the cases of tiling hexagons and triangles in the triangular grid, each can be extended to a tiling of the plane, as described in Figure 16.

Part (b) shows three tilings of the $2 \times 2$ grid that are equivalent under the torus action $\mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z}$. Part (c) shows a $2 \times 2$ Klein that is equivalent to the other Klein bottles under $180^{\circ}$ rotation.

\subsection*{6.5 Other tilings of the Euclidean plane}

Extending this idea even further, we might be interested in ways of placing multiple shapes of tiles on various tilings of the Euclidean plane by convex polygons, such as the truncated trihexagonal tiling, the snub square tiling, or the triakis triangular tiling.

Figure 17 shows an example of such a setup on a region of the truncated square grid. Ahmed [1] and Mitchell [21] gave examples of tilings on the truncated square grid and other Archimedean tilings of the Euclidean plane. as well as

\subsection*{6.6 Polyhedra}

We are also interested in settings related to polyhedra. For instance, one could use various tile designs to count the number of distinct tilings of a $2 \times 2 \times 2$ Rubik's cube-like object, as illustrated in Figure 18.

Similarly, one could do this analysis on other polyhedra. In 1997, Colour of Strategy released a puzzle called "Tantrix Rock," which featured square and hexagonal tiles placed on the vertices of a truncated octahedron [28]. Similar counting problems could be done on the other Platonic solids and Archimedean solids in addition to Johnson solids, prisms, antiprisms, and polyhedra whose faces are not regular polygons, such as the rhombic dodecahedron.

\subsection*{6.7 Hyperbolic plane}

In addition to the settings with no curvature (the plane) and positive curvature (polyhedra) it is also interesting to look at this in the negative curvature setting of the hyperbolic plane, as described by Dunham [10]. An example of this is illustrated in Figure 19.

\subsection*{6.8 Higher dimensional objects}

We are also interested in computing higher-dimensional analogs, such as where the tile designs are space-filling polyhedra. In the context of cubes, these have been considered by Schattschneider [26], Lord and Ranganathan [19], Browne [6]

\subsection*{6.9 Permuting tile colors}

In some illustrations, one may observe that two tilings are equivalent up to swapping the colors of the tiles, as illustrated in Figure 20. In Appendix B.5, you may notice that for each tiling in Figures 72 and 74 , swapping the colors of the tiling is equivalent to a $180^{\circ}$ rotation, a property that we would like to understand better.
