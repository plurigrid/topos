quick answer
I'll do my best! Collective wisdom metrics, in the context of category theory, refer to mathematical frameworks that combine individual opinions or judgments to produce a collective outcome, while preserving the relationships and structures between them. These metrics, built using covariant constructions, enable the aggregation of diverse perspectives, ensuring that the collective wisdom is more than just an average, and instead, captures the complex interactions and patterns within the group.
