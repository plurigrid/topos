Talk at Applied Category Theory 2023

We show that the double category Cat♯ of comonoids in the category of polynomial functors (previously shown by Ahman-Uustalu and Garner to be equivalent to the double category of small categories, cofunctors, and prafunctors) contains several formal settings for basic category theory, provides an elegant description of Weber’s nerve construction for generalized higher categories, and has subcategories equivalent to both the double category Org of dynamic rewiring systems and the double category PolyE of generalized polynomials in a finite limit category E. Also serving as a natural setting for categorical database theory, Cat♯ at once hosts models of a wide range of concepts from the theory and applications of polynomial functors and higher categories.

Intro
0:41
so we move to the next lecture my it's my pleasure and honor to announce David
0:48
SP from The topos Institute he will speak about all concepts are cat this
0:54
Dash I don't know please thank you bana um yes um so this
1:00
is Joint work with Owen Lynch and Brandon Shapiro
1:06
Shapiro okay uh so for the last 15 years I've wanted category Theory to help
Why Category Theory
1:12
Humanity make sense of its world so I started out with data migration where the idea was that differently organized
1:18
systems need to exchange information and then I was thinking about operatic compositionality how you could build new
1:25
systems from old by arranging them and then uh
1:33
think yeah is it recording
1:42
yeah I started sorry
1:49
okay uh and then I was thinking about interacting dynamical systems which is how collectives can act in
1:56
concert uh so I want category Theory to help make sense of its world but then why why use math for this well I think
2:03
mathematic I think of mathematical Fields as accounting systems there are ways that we account for things there ways you can give an account of say
2:10
quantities uh or likelihoods or physical observations or reasoning using an accounting system like arithmetic or
2:17
probability or Hilbert spaces or logic so you can account for something and give your accounts and scaffold the way
2:23
you're thinking using mathematics so and Math's universality in find two language
2:28
leads to this impressive coordination where I can work with somebody in China and we can I can give them a
2:33
differential equation to solve and they can come back and it'll actually Sol work with the thing that I'm I'm trying to do so this is really an amazing fact
2:40
about math we can give these accounting systems that actually work and then why category Theory well category theory is
2:46
even more finely tuned the language and principles were designed in the last 70 years instead over the last 3,000 years
2:53
uh and they're very elegant and it's the second thing is that they're constructive so it's more amendable to Tool building and applications and it's
2:59
a kind of microcosm of math it sits within math but it reflects the ma the structure of all of math or almost all
3:05
of math um and I think that that what I'm trying to talk about today is that the same story repeats at another level
3:11
within category Theory not not it it's not going to have everything in category Theory not even close but it but it
3:18
contains a lot of category Theory and it's subsumed within category theories so the title of my talks was that all
All Concepts are Cat
3:25
concepts are cat sharp this was a kind of joke uh and it's it's but it's alluding to Something in the in the book
3:31
uh category theories for the working math category theory for the working mathematician which has a section called all concepts are con extensions now that
3:39
that was an exaggeration mlan was exaggerating not all category theoretic Concepts let alone all concepts are con
3:45
extensions for example a category is not a con extension but it's such a far-reaching uh notion it covers ad
3:53
joints and Yetta and limits and colimits um those three not not so much more than
3:59
that but those three that the exaggeration was worthwhile to him he was saying look at how amazing con extensions are uh I I want to say that
4:06
the double category cat sharp is similarly far-reaching in a in in the
4:11
sense that it is not everything so not all concepts are cat sharp but many C ideas are so the categories funs co-
4:18
functors Pro functors natural Transformations Coos Cate co- preves and prees elements of a copri parametric R
4:25
ad joints uh nerve nerves of categories nerves of higher Cate ories nerves of
4:30
you know monoidal double categories uh polye for any category e with pullbacks
4:37
is all in cat sharp the same cat sharp you don't have to change it for the e um but not only for category Theory does it
4:43
have all these sorts of things but it also D models Dynamic organizational structures like um uh Mato was talking
4:49
about his thing today and and org is a kind of Sub sub thing of that um it's
4:55
used in deep learning it's used in prediction markets uh and many other applications from effects handlers uh in
5:02
in programming to rewriting like Chris has talked the other day data migration between databases Etc so many applied
5:07
category Theory Concepts live in the same place and many category Theory Concepts live in the same place so it's
5:13
elegant applicable and far-reaching so I think it's an important part of act and and that many Concepts live in one space
5:20
and the the advantage of that is for example if you implement this one thing you will get all of those things uh so in this talk I'll introduce
Outline
5:27
paully again uh just to make sure we all on the same page and Cat sharp and then I'll show just to give you some
5:33
familiarity with it I'll give you three homes for categories inside cat sharp then I'll explain uh how multivariate
5:40
polinomial and polye for an arbitrary category e fit in I would discuss nerves of categories I think that's really cool
5:47
but this is applied category Theory conference so I won't talk about nerves I'll instead talk about Dynamic arrangements and then I'll finally
5:53
conclude so Dynamic Arrangements is the only part of this that'll actually be applied um Okay so poly there are many
Poly
6:00
equivalent ways to get poly so the easiest the fast one fast way is say it's the free completely distributive
6:06
category on one object distributive means that you have products and sums and that they distribute past each other
6:12
and completely distributive just means you have more than just binary sums you have you know uh set set are fun uh sums
6:21
and products so you can take the product of infinitely many objects or the sum of infinitely many objects so that's one
6:26
way to say it free completely distributive category on one object another is well there's lots of functors from set to set and some are called
6:33
representable functors they're the easiest ones maybe um and I'll talk about them in a minute and these are the
6:39
the full subcategory of co-products of representa bles that's a kind of Hands-On way to talk about it and then a
6:46
third equivalent way is that it's the full subcategory of all those funes from set to set that preserve connected
6:52
limits which are basically like pullbacks and wide wider um span um wider pullbacks but to bring it
7:00
down to earth a representable functor is just something that takes any set X and returns a set of all functions from a to
7:06
X for some a so the fun the functor that takes an X and gives you back X squ for
7:11
any X that's representable or X cubed or x to the 4th and that's basically all of them X the 5th uh x to the natural
7:17
numbers so those are the representable functors and co-products of such things are pretty easy things to think about
7:23
they're just like you know you take x^2 + x Cub + 4 okay so they're polinomial
7:30
um of sets the maps between these things are Easy by the Universal Property of co-products everything's just a
7:36
co-product of representable so you use co-products and and Yona and what happens is that you take this co-product
7:41
and this co-product and you use the the Universal Property of co-product to pull this guy out and then you use y LMA to
7:48
plug AI in for y here so you get the thing pulled out you get the sum over J
7:54
and you get BJ to the a AI to the power BJ which is the set of functions from BJ to AI so it's some this formula tells
8:01
you that in order to get a polinomial map it's kind of a lensy thing if you saw David Jazz's talk it says for every
8:08
I and I pick a J and J and for every element of the of BJ pick an element of
8:16
AI but this category poly has an unprecedented amount of structure people talk about toposes of it's very
8:22
structured objects uh poly has a huge amount of structure maybe more it just doesn't have a subobject classifier but
8:28
it has and the sub object classifier gives you a lot of great stuff but it doesn't have that but it does have a lot
8:34
of great stuff so it has all limits and Co colimits it's got a notion of left con extensions inside of itself um so
8:41
it's what what's called a co- closure to composition it has three orthogonal factorization system someone talked
8:46
about uh who was it who talked about factorization systems it was um Bryce
8:51
has three different orthogonal factorization systems maybe more it has infinitely many monoidal closed
8:57
structures most people haven't heard of a category with more than two or three monoidal structures let alone a category
9:02
of two monoidal Clos structures that's maybe you've never heard of one uh this one has infinitely many monoidal clo
9:09
structures um it's got free monads co-free comonads and lawful interactions between them so it's just got like tons
9:14
of structure which you can use to build all sorts of interesting things you're constantly able to to take something
9:20
someone's talking about I I noticed I'm able to take uh Owen came to me and said here's what an effect Handler is he
9:26
showed me some stuff I rearranged rearranged rearranged we got a very simple definition uh that actually fits
9:32
into this talk so um it has many applications in functional programming in imperative programming which is kind
9:38
of the opposite side that usually category theorists don't want to touch and automata programming like cellular automata or finite statement automata so
9:45
it's really good for applications and for for Theory um and one of the first surprising things as we're getting
Categories
9:51
towards this thing called cat sharp is that kids in poly are exactly categories
9:57
that's just a weird fact usually usually if you take kids in something you expect to get something but what is it well
10:03
here the thing you get is called a category and we're in applied category Theory conference so what is a what is a
10:09
what's going on there so if polinomial are objects then when I want to compose them like take y^2 of Y +1 if I want to
10:17
compose those functors you would get this functor y^2 + 2 y + 1 but I'm going
10:23
to write it with this composition triangle symbol to mean I'm feeding Q into P but I'm using that instead of
10:28
this Circle just so we remember that we're not composing morphisms we're composing objects because the the
10:34
functors themselves from set to set are the objects so you can ask what are the kids and the monoids in this monoidal
10:41
structure in this monoidal category here it turns out that Mona monoids in this
10:46
are what are called cartisian monoids are are operads but Comm monoids are
10:52
categories and um so if we're looking at yeah the amazing fact is that there are
10:57
categories this is due to omin and ULU and morphisms but the weird thing though is that morphisms between them are not
11:04
functors they're called co- functors i'm not going to tell you what the those are rice talked about them a bit the the
11:09
other day um so a polinomial konad is pretty easy to say and then you work out
11:16
just set theoretically using that formula I showed you what it means so what is a comonad it's a polinomial c y
11:22
cubed plus y let's say and that'll come up later that polinomial y Cub plus Y
11:28
and a f map of polinomial so a natural transformation from that to the identity and a natural transformation to
11:34
that composed itself y Cub plus y of Y Cub plus y um now how how does such a
11:42
thing give you a category I'll tell you how given a category you get such a thing given a
11:47
category for any object in a write C bracket a to mean all of the maps out of
11:53
a not just the maps to something but the maps to anything so overall objects add
11:58
up all the maps to those objects so um right so this is a big set
12:04
all the maps out of a to anything uh now the associated polinomial that I would put here for
12:10
this category is the sum I'm supposed to give you a sum of representa bles so I give you the sum over all objects in C
12:17
of the of Y to the power Maps out of a so given an a what are all the maps out
12:23
that's the polinomial and that weird polinomial that you might never think of uh of map the basically if you look at
12:30
Epsilon and you looked at that formula I gave you before you could see that you could put the identity for every object
12:37
a you could pick the identity map out and that would be what Epsilon is and if you and Delta will say for any object in
12:43
any map out Delta will tell you the co-domain of it and then for any map out of that uh Delta will tell you the uh
12:51
composite so it's just kind of bizarre if you're looking at it on the screen right now because it's it's hard to
12:56
believe but categories and coma oids are the same thing so cat sharp is going to be what
13:03
we get when we apply Mike Schulman's definition of the of the comod construction uh to this so Mike Schulman
13:09
said that if you have any double category and it has nice coequalizers you can form something called mod D um
13:16
the the monoids and modules of D and if if something say P for poly has nice
13:22
equalizers then you can form comod P you can look at the kids and we just talked about
13:27
kids so any monoidal category you can think of as a vertically trivial double
13:32
category a monoidal category you can think of as a b category with one object and therefore you can think of it as a
13:38
double category it just has one dot but has got lots of things from the dot to itself and those things can compose uh
13:46
and that's going to be um what we're going to think of as P so p is going to be the one object double category
13:52
Associated to poly so it's got only one object it's got poly many maps from that object to itself and then we can compose
13:59
them and that thing has nice local equalizers or uh so what that means is
14:04
it has equalizers for any two polom meals you can it has all limits I said so you can take the limit of of any pair
14:10
of maps and from this we can form comod P so we can take Mike Schulman's
14:16
definition and just run it on P and we get a double category and so what double category do we get while we get
14:23
something that I'm calling cat sharp and the reason is that by am andalo the objects are precisely the small cat
14:28
categories so it's got the same objects as cat but the vertical morphisms in cat sharp are a little bit sharp like you
14:36
when you look at the vertical ones what do I mean by they're sharp I mean that uh they're co- functors not functors
14:42
they're a little surprising that's what I mean by sharp um so sharp is this notation sharp comes from the from like
14:49
algebraic geometry where you have morphism of scheme say or ringed spaces you have a map forward on the topological spaces and then backwards on
14:55
the sheaves so that's I just remember reading harda and seeing that cat sharp that sharp notation and uh and I kind of
15:03
use that to to to notate the maps back that you get on uh for lenses or polinomial funes anyway so um it's a
15:11
kind of way of differentiating it from normal cat uh and and so we've talked about the vertical morphisms and the
15:16
objects and Richard Garner explained in this uh in his hottest video uh that the
15:21
horizontal morphisms the bico modules whatever Schulman told us we're supposed to do he says oh those are really great
15:28
things those are called parametric right adjoint or Pro functors these are functors from D sets to C sets and it
15:35
turned out that back in like 2011 or 12 I was defining what I thought was the
15:41
right kind of maps between databases and those were exactly the maps that I thought were the right kind so
15:49
um so these are the parametric right ad joints it takes any D set and moves it
15:54
to a c set in a composable way so we can take another one from C set to B B set or whatever uh by every object in C
16:01
basically gets a disjoint Union of conjunctive queries on D so these Prof
16:06
functors are more General than Pro functors they're like C indexed sums of pro functors so you could say things
16:13
like I want all pairs of men with the same favorite book or women with the same favorite book or men and women with
16:18
the same favorite book take the union of those three conjunctive queries and pop that into a single table and that's the
16:24
kind of way you can move data from D set to C set and that's the kind of thing that you just get automatically by
16:29
running Mike Schulman's construction uh on on poly the one object um by category
16:35
or just poly okay so to make cat sharp more uh
Catsharp
16:41
palatable or understandable or something I wanted to show you show you around a bit so take you around what's in this
16:46
cat sharp thing so it's an equipment of Comon okay so here's a very short description cat sharp is the equipment
16:52
of kids in the distributive completion of one that's a complete description of cat sharp and and the point is why would
17:00
you you could say well why do I care about distributive completions why do I care about chrom monoids why do I care about this sort of thing because you
17:07
might not guess that that's really a great thing the Comon and distributive completion of one all you'd know is that
17:13
it has a very short description In classical category Theory language the equipment of Co Comm monoids and the
17:18
distributive completion of one but it's often a good sign to have a very short description CT language because CT
17:23
language was refined such as short descriptions are are not like short shortly describable things are nice so
17:30
kids in set one times this is a monoidal category so you could say what are the com the what is Mike Schulman's
17:36
construction of of comod on this well you get span or if you take set Zer plus and you take monoids you get C-SPAN so
17:43
we talked about C-SPAN earlier today those are also uh comod comod equipments
17:48
or mod equipments and if you take span and you take the monoids in Span you get
17:53
proof or cat so cat not cat sharp cat is
17:58
monads in Span and span is K kids in set and so you can that that shows that cat
18:04
also has a really short description so shortly describable things are pretty nice things but there's there's a lot
18:10
more to say about cat sharp than that it has a short description and one is and that is I want to give you these three
18:15
homes for categories and the first home for categories is the least familiar to you but the most top of mind for this
18:21
discussion namely that they're the kids and poly so categories are kids and poly I've said that I want to keep repeating
18:27
it because it's so so surprising uh but you you can find funes in this home for
18:34
categories but they're kind of tucked away and hardly relevant you it's like what are funter here and Todd Trimble
18:40
gave a talk at uh at the poly conference what are funter and one way you could
18:45
say is that every funter shows up as an adjunction in cat sharp in fact they constitute the left class of a certain
18:50
factorization on left ad joints it's kind of like a terrible way like funter are very difficult to describe in some
18:57
sense in cat Sharp natively right sitting right there so that's why I want to give you two better homes for
19:03
categories because you want to be thinking about categories and funter not these new weird co- functors they're co-
19:08
functors are actually really cool Bryce can tell you how cool they are I can tell you how cool they are but sometimes you just want to a funter um so the
19:17
first thing I want to say is that span the category of span spans lives inside of cat sharp as the linear pols so I
19:24
said that a horizontal morphism in cat sharp is a bicom module I didn't quite tell you what that means it means we I
19:30
already told you what composition was and a bicom module is just a polinomial p equipped with a map that way and a map
19:36
that way to C composed p and to P composed D and it satisfies certain laws with respect to like killing off the C
19:42
variable and stuff like that using the co-unit and the co- multiplication and stuff like that but I'm still astounded
19:48
that this sort of thing just like a single polinomial with two maps that satisfy some laws is giving you the
19:54
information of an entire uh data migration query it takes any you know D
20:00
set and gives you a c set more more General than Pro functors So Pro functors are these things where p is uh
20:08
uh is a polinomial with only one with like with Y to the sum power okay so Pro
20:14
functors live in here where this is just a representable um so a single polinomial
20:20
plus two lawful Maps gives you all of data migration that's pretty amazing and then B modules to zero are exactly fun
20:27
to set so those are the pre sheeps those are just Bic modules from C to zero uh
20:32
and so if you looked at only linear pols what would you get what if you required C to be a linear polinomial so it was C
20:38
* Y and what if you required all your your things here your bicom modules to be linear then you would get span and so
20:45
we can find span as just the most basic part of of cat sharp just the ones with linear pols and then it's it's well
20:52
known that monads and span are categories so we can get we can find Span in here and we can look at the monads and we get cat so that's the
20:59
second home for categories and the third home for categories is that um I is that
21:05
we can I should probably move a little faster here's a here's the uh category who indexes graphs functors from this to
21:12
set are exactly graphs and this corresponds to the polinomial Y Cub plus y because this thing has three Maps out
21:19
identity and two more and this thing has one map out and so this is the kid this is the carrier of the comid of graphs
21:26
and so a graph is just a Bic module from this little thing y Cub + y to zero uh
21:32
and now Prof functors parametric right adjoints might be useful new to you but they're really useful and so path for
21:38
example is a really good one it's a map from graph to graph and it sends an arbitrary graph to the graph of all
21:44
paths in that in that graph so that's called a familial functor or a or a polinomial functor
21:51
from g to g um and it's well known that path is a monad so this thing compos
21:57
itself maps to itself and so path is a monad on G and a path algebra is a
22:04
category it's a graph together with a map from paths in that graph to that
22:09
graph any path in me counts as a map in me or more an edge in me so that's the
22:16
third home for categories is that they're the path complete graphs that's probably the most familiar way to think
22:21
about categories some people like to think about monads in Span but graphs where you can compose paths is the usual
22:26
way of thinking about um categories okay the most common
22:31
complaints about poly are that uh they people know that it's we flowing with structure but people naturally want more
22:38
and their most common asks are I want multivariate polinomial and you only care about univariate polinomial or they
22:45
they yell at me uh I want polinomial in E I want topological spaces I don't want I want measure spaces I want um
22:52
diffeological spaces I don't want just sets at the bottom and so I want to consider both of these at once
22:58
uh and look at Poly e for an arbitrary e this is uh in the sense of Gambino and Co and Weber so if e is a category with
23:06
pullbacks you can Define this double category poly e and the univariate polinomial in it the ones with one
23:11
variable like like the ones I'm talking about usually are just maps in E and the
23:17
multivariate polinomial are are these Bridge diagrams and so if you took e to
23:22
be set what this bridge diagram would correspond to would be J many polins in I many VAR
23:28
variables and we can find poly e inside of cat sharp not inside of some cat sh sub but inside of the cat Shar we
23:35
already had so what you do is you take any full dense subcategory of e you could use e itself so if e was cat you
23:43
could use the zero one two and two simplies and be done um uh you find any
23:49
dense subcategory you want and then the category of I'm just going to skip ahead the category of all uh multivariate
23:58
polinomial in E so we have many variables we're in an arbitrary e and
24:03
now we're embedded into cat sharp uh by this pattern here and I'm not going to explain it because I'm running low on
24:08
time but it's in the paper so uh if you just want multi multivariate polinomial
24:13
in set since one is dense in set every element of every set is a cimit of one
24:19
one element sets then we can find poly subset as the full sub double category
24:25
of cat sharp spanned by discrete categories so we take cat sharp we just look instead of all categories as our
24:31
objects we just look at the discret ones and we'll find poly subset in the sense of G Gambino and
24:37
so we're not scared that we need all sorts of different poly e for different e we've got them all inside of
Dynamic Functions
24:43
cat sharp the last thing I want to talk about is dynamic functions and dynamic Arrangements uh we often think of
24:49
functions as machines that take an input and give an output that are automatic and deterministic and total and they
24:55
don't change when you use them but in real life machines change as you use them so the keys on your keyboard if you
25:00
use it too much it might it might you know wear off or your shoes wear down according to how you walk or your
25:06
baseball glove gets broken in right or your brain gets you know as you use this thing yes no matter what you show me
25:12
right now I will respond it is a function but what I see from you is changing me and that's a pretty
25:18
important kind of computer and I want to think of that as a dynamic function it's a function from A to B but that function
25:23
depends on the state and then given a new input a that's the sort of thing that changes the state so as I hear from
25:30
you as I look at you that's changing my state I'm still a function at any moment in time but the function I am is
25:35
changing and so those are exactly the AY comma by coalgebras so there's an internal hm I told you that paully has
25:42
lots of cartis lots of monoidal closures and so this is one of them and if I look at this the coalgebras for this these
25:49
are these Dynamic functions functions that change through time they're also called melee machines uh but you can do
25:56
this more generally so here here's the I I I've written out why that's true why a y b y coalgebras are melee
26:03
machines but more generally any wiring diagram is also a map in poly this one
26:08
would be a map from P1 tensor P2 tensor p34 five to Q this picture of wiring is
26:14
an information flow thing where like uh like positions of this one are flowing into directions of that one or whatever
26:20
I probably didn't use that terminology but these things are FL information is Flowing around like for dynamical
26:25
systems Etc and wiring diagram is a map in poly if I want that wiring diagram to
26:31
change based on what flows through the wires then I'm looking at a coalgebra on this thing on the internal H so I take
26:39
P1 tensor P5 call that P and then the PQ coalgebras are machines that produce
26:45
wiring diagrams like this or more General things like uh artificial neural network uh weights and biases and they
26:53
listen to What flows in and out of this system and they update the parameters ET ET or the wiring pattern based on that
26:59
so it's Dynamic Arrangements if you wanted uh some kind someone asked a question about um games where what's
27:06
going on in the game changes the wiring of the game itself and that's the sort of thing you can do using Dynamic
27:12
arrangements so you can po package all of this into a manal double category called org and Org the point is that org
27:19
lives inside of cat sharp um I'm not yeah org also lives in cat sharp and um
27:25
I don't think I have time to tell you why but uh it's on these slides if you want to see later so Dynamic
27:31
Arrangements Arrangements like a baseball glove that can listen to what happens what inputs you get and change
27:37
based on that like artificial neuronal networks that listen to the training data and update themselves based on that
27:42
those live in org but org is a subset of cat sharp so that's one I guess once we saw how many different things like
27:48
effects handlers and rewriting and org and nerve theorems and all these things lived in cat sharp that's what inspired
27:54
us to say that uh all concepts are cat sharp so I think that having this kind of unified and readymade notation means
28:02
that you don't have to con constantly be context switching every time you want to learn a new thing you can see if it fits
28:07
into inside this inside of if is it a profunctor or a co- functor or parametric r adjoint or a dynamic
28:12
Arrangement or is it a is it a nerve what is it and you you'll find your klyy categories you'll find your things um
28:19
inside of this thing so it's a it's a setting in which to do both formal category Theory and applied category
28:24
Theory thanks [Applause]
28:33
thank you David H some quick questions one or two one
28:40
maybe hi thanks for the talk um so you relay this story about someone coming up
28:46
to you uh they told you a concept uh yeah Owen and um and you did you know
28:52
this that and the other thing and you got it into poly your cat sharp um is there a sense in which which this
28:57
process could be regularized or automated and applied to the internet or
29:04
something uh that that would be really cool um I don't know so what happened was
29:10
Owen wrote down a big formula and like I was like oh that part I could rewrite oh
29:16
wait now that I have that that part I could rewrite so I did some rewrite rules and rewrite rules uh maybe could
29:22
be those could be implemented and in fact with with uh Chris we did like Dynamic rewriting and stuff like that so
29:29
uh searching for the rewrite rules could be automated I don't know about like like I think searching the internet and
29:35
doing that automatically is like 20 years away or something I don't know what that is who knows what the acceleration but like that feels 20
29:42
years away using with chat with with AI or whatever like I don't know feels far to me uh but like um but uh yeah but
29:51
some kind of rewriting Theory and searching through rewrite possible rewrites could be four I don't know I'm
29:57
I'm bad at technology speeds but computer algebra
30:05
system like we could do Compu a computer algebra system for the formal theory of
30:12
cat sharp yeah right which wouldn't do what you wanted but would be
30:19
cool I think what you want is is is pretty science fiction right now but I mean it be yeah it should be possible at
30:25
some point yeah and let's go to that online question oh
30:32
is it
30:37
yours um okay the only question I don't in find my mouse can you please is it
30:44
yours someone says uh thanks David is The Duality Comon instead of monoids
30:49
preep instead of co- preps really essential other than for applications it's not ESS I mean it's uh it's I I
30:57
mean Comm monoids are categories you can't really monoids are more like operads so what are called cartisian
31:02
monads are operads so they kind of switch directions of things instead of looking at all maps out you're looking
31:08
at map you're kind of looking at the the the inputs of your of your morphism um
31:14
I'm not sure if I'm answering your question copr sheep copre sheeps instead of pre-
31:20
sheaves that's just a matter of um I I think that's might maybe a matter
31:26
of like how you arrange your pols whether you look at Maps out or maps in so I don't think that that's super
31:34
essential um yeah I'm we don't time for any more questions let's thank David
31:42
again
