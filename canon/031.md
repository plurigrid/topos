Worlding and Unworlding
}

Steen Ledet Christiansen / steen@id.aau.dk I am interested in worlds that do not make sense; they are inconsistent, incoherent, and incompossible

\section{Overview}

1. Fictional Worlds Theories

2. Possible Worlds Theories

3. Worldbuilding Theories

4. Worlding

5. Unworlding

\section{Definition of Fictional Worlds}

- Eric Hayot: "the unity of form, diegesis, and feeling composed by the rough totality of a work: the world of the work of art." ("On Literary Worlds")

- Marie-Laure Ryan: fictional worlds are a "connected set of objects and individuals; habitable environment; reasonably intelligible totality for external observers; field of activity for its members" (Possible Worlds, Artificial Intelligence, and Narrative Theory) 1. Fictional Worlds Premise: Fictional worlds relate to the actual world in significant ways

\section{Key Terms}



\section{Composition and decomposition speak to the organization of the fictional world; what is included or left out}

\section{Walter Abish, Alphabetical Africa}

Constrained writing - only allowed to use words with the letters of the alphabet in sequence

\section{A}

Ages AGo, Alex, Allen and Alva arrived at Antibes, and Alva allowing all, allowing anyone, against Alex's admonition, against Allen's angry assertion: another African amusement ... anyhow, as all argued, an awesome African army assembled and arduously advanced against an African anthill, assiduously annihilating ant after ant, and afterward, Alex astonishingly accuses Albert as also accepting Africa's antipodal ant annexation. Albert argumentatively answers at another apartment. Answers: ants are Ameisen. Ants are Ameisen?

Africa again: Antelopes, alligators, ants and attractive Alva, are arousing all angular Africans, also arousing author's analytically aggressive anticipations, again and again. Anyhow author apprehends Alva anatomically, affirmatively and also accurately. Crossing ANOTHER COUNTrY: Alex and Allen cajoling a bank clerk, come along, come along, convert captivating currency, clipping coupons and buy cheap cotton canopy containing cannabis. Coming by car colonialists avoid anthills, but are confronted by curious cannabis chewing custom, but colonialists avoid customs, by checking charts containing African cattle crossing captions. Anyhow all being briefed beforehand, come carrying critical chapter about Chad, absolutely critical as always, as August advances, colonialists break a couple bones, and being concerned about assuming control, cut all avenues, cut banana crop, cut cables and capture captivating Afrikanische Ameisen. After another crossing colonialists change currency, change certain complex conduits, creating a concern among captured Chadians . . . come, come, always complaining about colonialists changing African air. Aiii. Cut.

The waves broke and spread their waters swiftly over the shore. One after another they massed themselves and fell; the spray tossed itself back with the energy of their fall. The waves were steeped deep-blue save for a pattern of diamondpointed light on their backs which rippled as the backs of great horses ripple with muscles as they move. The waves fell; withdrew and fell again, like the thud of a great beast stamping.

SBULA NWARD-WYINNING. cows AnTHose The lower end of New Pavē (so called somewhere between ten and ten thousand years) was one with the dockside. Along the upper end, where the road dipped down again to cross the Bridge Of Lost Desire, male and female prostitutes loitered or drank in the streets or solicited along the bridge's walkways, many come over from exotic places and many spawned by old Kolhari herself, most of them brown by birth and darkened more by summer, like the fine, respectable folk of the city (indeed, like himself), though there were a few with yellow hair, pale skin, gray eyes, and their own lisping language (like Meise) bespeaking barbaric origins.

It came in an exquisite Spode tea service, with a silver sugar-bowl and a plateful of hot buttered toast with Gentleman's Relish or honey, on a large melamine tray designed, Roland saw, to slot into the arms of the wheelchair. Connectedness is about narrative and character connection: high degree of connection produces smaller world, low degree of connection produces larger world

\section{James Cameron, Titanic}

Massive cast but clear focus on Jack and Rose

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_07_17_3ba68ef556414cb26c98g-044.jpg?height=3725&width=2568&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=4090)



\section{Charles Dickens, Bleak House}

Massive cast to suggest social totality

\section{Fictional worlds theories are interested in}

- How narrative shape and present the world

- What relations are produced between storyworld and real world

- The kind of totality produced by narrative-world-character structure

- Such totalities may be various forms of realisms

- Or fantastical worlds that comment on/engage with contemporary issues

\section{Fictional worlds theories are interested in the critical potential of fictional worlds}

2. Possible Worlds Premise: fiction can contain certain kinds of truth; the worlds created by fiction consist of a range of practices that produce, limit, and place into conflict various truth-claims

\section{Key Terms}

Nuclear and extranuclear qualities are a crucial distinction for possible worlds theories, providing factual qualities in the possible world, while demarcating that which cannot be factual (i.e. the fiction itself)

\section{Vincent Vega}

- Nuclearly:

- A hitman who works for Marcellus Wallace

- Went to France and ate at McDonald's

- A good dancer

- Extranuclearly:

- John Travolata

- Who danced in Grease and Saturday Night Fever

- In a Tarantino movie

- That recycles genres and emphasizes interesting dialog

- Typically employs non-linear plots

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_07_17_3ba68ef556414cb26c98g-052.jpg?height=3529&width=2193&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=4465)



\section{Orsinia}

- Nuclearly:

- An independent Central European country

- Later dependent on the Austrian Empire

- Embroiled in World War I

- Became an East bloc country

- Tried to rebel but this rebellion was crushed

- After non-violent protests in 1989, free elections were introduced - Extranuclearly:

- A fictonal country invented by Ursula K. Le Guin across several short stories and novels

- Bears Ursula's name

- Ursula is a diminutive of "female bear"

- Ursinus is bear-like

\section{Crucially, for possible worlds theories, both sets of facts are true and do not negate each other}



\section{The pursuit of factual statements}

lead to dual ontologies objects, places, people, and more may be fictionally actual, while actually fictional

\section{Kingsley Amis, The Alteration}

The Reformation never happened and Protestantism only exists in New England

\section{The Dark Crystal (Jim Henson and Frank Oz 1982)}

A world with no humans, not set on Earth.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_07_17_3ba68ef556414cb26c98g-060.jpg?height=3742&width=2729&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=3925)

Narrative length related to possible world size is measured in density, which is extensional

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_07_17_3ba68ef556414cb26c98g-063.jpg?height=3759&width=6591&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=72)

\section{1: A Space Odyssey}

Rich in symbolic and abstract knowledge

\section{Frank Herbert, Dune}

Richly textured world that often overwhelms the reader (Side note continued: Even as popular culture tends toward low density, it also tends towards high saturation / ontological wealth)

\section{Authentication is the process through which the possible world is established as fact}



\section{Coraline (Henry Selick 2009)}

\section{lain Banks, The Bridge}

The protagonist is in a wreck on a bridge and most of the novel is comprised of lyrical fantasies, that may (and may not) be analogies of his coma

\section{Possible worlds theories are interested in}

- How fictions establish referential truth

- Can be rephrased as how fiction knows (or how the ontology of fiction can produce epistemology)

- For this reason, possible worlds theories reject contradictory worlds

- Impossible worlds are easy to deal with, because they can be internally possible

- Or impossible worlds can be naturalized by shifting authentication frames

\section{Worldbuilding}



\section{Premise: Imaginary worlds differ from the primary world but can be fully realized}



\section{Key Terms}

Secondariness is how different the imaginary world is from the primary world (mostly parallel to possible worlds theories' departure)

\section{Avatar (James Cameron 2008)}

Although a completely different world (including visually), the logics of the primary world still hold

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_07_17_3ba68ef556414cb26c98g-078.jpg?height=3640&width=2525&top_left_y=136&top_left_x=4129)



\section{Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland}

Tied to the primary world but most of our logic detaches in Wonderland

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_07_17_3ba68ef556414cb26c98g-079.jpg?height=3562&width=2489&top_left_y=-4&top_left_x=4002)

Readers and viewers gestalt the imaginary world to fill out details that are left out (this is parallel to Ryan's principle of minimal departure)

\section{Worldbuilding theories are interested in}

- The realization of imaginary worlds

- The mimetic function of imaginary worlds

- Worldbuilding theories thus accept possible worlds theories, yet do not require modal logic

- The narrative aperture of worlds; what other stories can be told in this world? Break

\section{Discussion Interlude}

- What role does worlds play for your project?

- Which branch of world theories are best suited

- What totalities are produced by your theoretical approach?

\section{Worlding: Worlds as Experience}



\section{Premise: Fictional worlds offer}

experiences different from that world's structure (fictionality), truthfulness (possibility), or detail (realization)

\section{Worlds can be in excess of narrative information; there is more to a fictional world than its storyworld}

Fictional worlds theories, possible worlds, and worldbuilding theories focus on the extensity of worlds (they are divisible)

\section{Worlding focuses on the intensity of worlds (they are indivisible)}



\section{In light of affect theory, fictional worlds take on more textures than narrative}



\section{Affect understood as presubjective intensities that permeate, suffuse, and constitute experience}



\section{Key Terms}



\section{Atmosphere connects density,}

saturation, immersion, and world gestalten as the background feeling of a world

\section{One pleasure of fiction is dwelling in the world, even without a narrative payoff}

He thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in his life had he seen a river before-this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again. All was a-shake and a-shiver-glints and gleams and sparkles, rustle and swirl, chatter and bubble.

\section{Worlding is interested in}

- The experience of fictional worlds

- The affective affordances of a fictional world, in excess of narrative

- The aesthetic potentials of fictional worlds

- How aesthetic expression may challenge our knowledge of the world

\section{Worlding's relation to fictional worlds theories, possible worlds theories, and worldbuilding is parallel to Gumbrecht's distinction between meaning effects and presence effects}

A fictional world's expression (it's atmosphere, the ways it invites dwelling, how it produces a world-feeling) is its worlding, its propositional form It is more important that a proposition be interesting than that it be true.

Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas, 244 5. Unworlding

\section{Premise: There is something beyond and between the possible and not possible}



\section{Unworlding is against totalities}

- Eric Hayot: "the unity of form, diegesis, and feeling composed by the rough totality of a work: the world of the work of art." ("On Literary Worlds")

- Marie-Laure Ryan: fictional worlds are a "connected set of objects and individuals; habitable environment; reasonably intelligible totality for external observers; field of activity for its members" (Possible Worlds, Artificial Intelligence, and Narrative Theory)

\section{Leibniz distinguishes between the compossible and the incompossible}

- God has created the best of all possible worlds

- Possible worlds are real but not actualized by God

- Why does evil and suffering still exist?

- Because God can only create a world that is compossible - logically coherent and non-contradictory

- God cannot create what is incompossible

\section{"Un" is a "complex process of negation beyond the reaches of opposition, inversion, and antithesis"}

Botting 2018, 192

\section{Unnatural Narratives}

- Denarration (Richardson) or unnarration (Warhol) - the narration states something and then states the opposite. This complicates story-discourse level, because how does the reader construct a story?

- Cognitive balance (Alber) - the reader has several ways to naturalize or integrate unnatural narratives Much unnatural narratology has been developed in relation to postmodernist, metafictional, and other experimental forms of writing

\section{Speculative fiction is not unnatural, since it predominantly attempts to make its world both possible and compossible}



\section{(Side note: For a provocative take on the idea of science fiction and mimesis, read Seo- Young Chu's Do Metaphors Dream of Literal Sheep?)}

A recent trend in speculative fiction takes postmodernist writing not as a new, radical practice but something that has been internalized (slipstream, (new) weird, slipstream, interstitial fiction, and more) - These worlds contradict the actual world

- They also contradict the fictional world; while the contradictions may be a crucial mystery (as in Annihilation) it can never be resolved

- These fictions do not unnarrate, since the world exists

\section{I propose that these fictions unworld}



\section{These fictional worlds are incompossible yet actual; the worlds exist but are illogical and contradictory on a diegetic level}



\section{Unworlding effects are affectively estranging, fulfilling some strange state of actual-but-not- real}

Coherence and

\section{The Cipher}

- Overlapping actualizations

- No actual event is wrong; the world proliferates in potentials

\section{Contradictions / In}

\section{the Earth and}

\section{Annihilation}

- The fictional world contradicts our actual world and the fictional world

- Things that cannot happen still manifest; this is made explicit in the story Erasures / The Outside and The Worm and His Kings

- Revealing that the actual world is incompossible

- Erasing potentialities without actualizing

Thrall, Mary SanGiovanni, author of

\section{Withdrawals / The}

Maxx and Lucy in the Sky

- The story keeps teetering on the edge of actualizing a fictional world

- These actualizations withdraw; we never know if the world exists or is delusion

Negations / Nameless

- Every world-making instance is negated

- The story builds a fictional world only to undercut/ unnarrate it

- This is the actual world, but not

- Refuses the actual world in favor of potentialities
